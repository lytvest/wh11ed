// GDM 2026 mission cards — Warhammer 40,000 11th ed. primary & secondary missions.
// Source: https://game-datamissions.com/11th/{primary,secondary}-missions
// Rules are published only as card IMAGES; this text was transcribed from those cards
// (download them with `python3 scripts/fetch-mission-cards.py`; `image` holds each path).
//
// EN-only data: `ru` aliases `en` (mission names/rules are language-agnostic).
//
// primary  = { type, deck, slug, name, opponent, mirror?, image, lore?, briefing?, blocks }
//   deck = your Force Disposition; opponent = the matchup disposition; mirror when same.
//   lore = the card's flavour text (the collapsible "Lore" panel in the official app),
//     shown after the title on the Missions page and hidden by the "hide lore" toggle.
// secondary = { type, role:'attacker'|'defender', slug, name, category, image, lore?, briefing?, whenDrawn?, blocks }
//   block = { kind?:'fixed'|'tactical', heading, when?, rows:[{ text, vp, modifier? }] }
//   vp is a number, or a '+N' string for cumulative bonuses; modifier ∈ 'or'|'cumulative'.
//   whenDrawn = the card's WHEN DRAWN deck action, applied one-tap in the tracker (tactical only):
//       { mode:'discard'|'shuffle', gate?:'first-round'|{ pairedActive:'<slug>' } }
//     mode 'discard' = card leaves play (not redrawable); 'shuffle' = card returns to deck.
//     gate omitted = board-state condition the app can't check (always offered; briefing is the
//     reminder). Language-agnostic logic (lives in EN only; survives the RU briefing overlay).
//   briefing = the card's intro text above the scoring blocks (only some cards have one),
//     an array of parts (rendered in order); each part is either
//       { label?, text }                       — a paragraph (label e.g. 'When Drawn', uppercased in UI)
//       { action, rows:[{ label, text }] }      — an OBJECTIVE ACTION block (Cleanse/Plunder)
//     Plain text, no markdown (matches rows.text). Transcribed from the card fronts and, for
//     the primary OBJECTIVE ACTION cards, from the official app (which reveals the card reverse).
