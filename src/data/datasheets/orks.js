// Orks — datasheets. Rewritten for Codex: Orks (app data 946), which replaced the whole
// faction; unit roster and points from src/data/mfm/orks.js (MFM v1.4).
// wh40k-appdata is the source of truth — `npm run sync` diffs this file against it.
// Lazy-loaded per faction via src/data/datasheets/index.js — do not import statically.
//
// Three things the new codex data does NOT carry, all gaps in the source rather than here:
//   - `lore` is null on 72 of 73 Orks sheets, so `flavor` is inherited from the previous
//     transcription wherever the unit survived (including the two renames) and is simply
//     absent on the fourteen sheets that are new.
//   - `factionKeywords` is empty on every sheet; ORKS is restored here.
//   - "Damaged" became a core ability carrying its own generic text (`Damaged 6`), so the
//     per-sheet `damaged` block is gone except on the older-format Imperial Armour sheet.
//
// `legends: true` marks the twelve sheets in Legends: Orks - the first Legends publication
// GW has shipped in app data. They are listed alongside everything else and filtered in the
// UI, not hidden.
