// What a game keeps track of — one table, read by everything that offers, defaults or obeys the
// choice. Before this file the flags were written out by hand in the wizard AND in
// EditSetupModal, and the two copies had already drifted: the wizard offered the army-rule toggle
// for any chosen faction (with a "reference only" note), the edit dialog only for a faction with a
// tracker spec — so a game whose faction had none showed a card that could never be turned off.
// A row here is offered in both places or in neither, by construction.
//
// A row is:
//   id           stable key (tests, help modal)
//   setting      the field it writes on game.settings
//   group        which block it belongs to: 'game' (the tracker itself) | 'roster' (only means
//                anything with an army list attached)
//   label        ui.js key — the checkbox's caption, and the help modal's title
//   help         ui.js key — one paragraph saying what turning it off costs
//   default      what a game gets when nobody chose, INCLUDING every game saved before the flag
//                existed. Never change one without meaning to change old saved games too.
//   remember     carry the last finished game's choice into the next setup
//   legacy       an older field name still sitting in saved games (read-only fallback)
//   requires     another row's `setting` this one hangs off; off there is off here, whatever this
//                row's own value says. Drawn as a child of that row.
//   local        this PHONE's choice, not the game's: kept out of the shared-game sync
//                (gameSlices.js) and the one kind of row a guest may flip in a game another phone
//                hosts. Everything else on the setup dialog is the host's, because it is the game.
//   enabled      (ctx) => boolean — whether the row can be flipped in THIS game
//   unavailable  (ctx) => ui.js key | null — why not, printed under a disabled caption
//   note         (ctx) => ui.js key | null — a caveat printed under an enabled caption
//
// **Every row is always listed.** A row that cannot apply yet is drawn disabled with the reason,
// never hidden: hiding made the list a different length in every game, and it meant "Track phases"
// was seen only by someone who had already attached a list — the people who needed telling were
// exactly the ones who never saw it. Its help button stays live, because what a greyed-out option
// would do is precisely what you want to read while it is greyed out.
//
// `ctx` is `{ you, opp, anyRoster }`, each side `{ faction, trackable }` — keyed by SIDE, not by
// index, because the players array is reordered by first turn once the game starts (players[0] is
// the first-turn player, `isYou` says which side that is).
//
// Turning a row off HIDES a block, it never clears what it tracked: a CP count, a flipped
// condition and a spent stratagem all stay in the game, so a toggle flipped mid-game is fully
// reversible. Readers therefore gate the UI on `tracks()` and leave the state alone. For the
// modifier rows that means a switched-off family stops PROVING its conditions, so the numbers it
// held fall back into the "possible" list with their condition text — the honest degradation a
// game without phases already has. A disabled family can make the card say less; it can never
// make it say something false.
//
// NOT everything on the game screen may become a row. **The missions are the game** — the primary,
// the secondaries and the way they are scored are what the tracker is FOR, and a switch that hides
// them (or swaps condition-scoring for a hand-typed number) offers to turn the app into a
// notepad. Both were built and removed on 2026-08-25 for exactly that reason. A row here has to be
// an aid AROUND the game — a counter, a reference card, a clock — never the game itself.
