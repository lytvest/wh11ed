// Fill the offline caches with everything the app SHELL deliberately does not carry.
//
// The service worker precaches ~1 MB: the entry chunk, what it statically imports, its CSS, the
// HTML and the icons (vite.config.js's offlineShell). Everything else — the route components, the
// thirty factions' data chunks, the font subsets, the ~21 MB of images — is runtime-cached as it
// is viewed. That is what keeps a browser tab light, and it is also what makes an update land in
// seconds instead of minutes: a new service worker only takes over once its install has finished.
//
// The price is that "offline" now means "offline for what you have already opened". This module is
// how that gets paid off, in one pass, deliberately:
//
//   • the installed app does it by itself on the first online launch, as it always has;
//   • anyone else asks for it — the ⚙ menu's "Download for offline" (AppNavbar.vue).
//
// Every fetch is served and stored by the SW's own CacheFirst routes (`/assets/` and `/images/`),
// so nothing here touches the Cache API directly: a plain fetch is enough to populate them.
