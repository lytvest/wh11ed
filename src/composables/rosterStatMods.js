// Apply the numeric modifier layer (Tier C) to a datasheet. Pure — no Vue, no data imports; the
// caller hands in the records it loaded and the rule prose they were read from.
//
// THE ONE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES: a number is only ever rewritten when the modifier is
// UNCONDITIONAL — or when the caller can prove the condition holds right now. Anything else with
// a `when` is annotated beside the printed value and the value is left alone.
//
// The proof comes from `active`, a set of condition ids the game says are true (built by
// rosterGameContext.js from a live tracker game). An effect's `cond` lists the ids that must ALL
// hold; anything not in the set — including every effect whose condition can never be answered
// (see conditions.js's sentinels) — stays an annotation. A note that WAS applied this way keeps
// its `when` text and carries `via`, so the card can say "T6 because the Waaagh! is on" rather
// than presenting a context-dependent number as if it were printed. 40k modifiers are overwhelmingly conditional — a phase, a range, an aura, once per
// battle — and a card showing T6 when the +1 only applies while a Waaagh! is running is worse
// than a card showing T5 with a note. The same goes for a value this file cannot compute (a
// Damage of "D6+2" with "+1"): it degrades to an annotation rather than inventing arithmetic.
//
// Scope comes from ruleTargets.js, never from the record — see the generator's header for why.

//           that leader ("…add 1 to the Strength characteristic of melee weapons equipped by
//           Bodyguard models in that unit" — Fabius Bile's Enhanced Warriors). GW writes
//           "Bodyguard models" exactly when it means to leave the Character out, which is rare.
//   unit    "while this model is leading a unit, models in that unit have…" — the ordinary Leader
//           wording, and the one that includes the leader himself: Core Rules 19.04, "abilities
//           that affect a unit (or models in it) apply to EVERY model in an attached unit". So it
//           lands on both cards — the led unit's, and the leader's own while he is leading one
//           (a leader standing alone leads nobody, and the rule says nothing). Until 2026-08-25
//           these were written `led`, which is why a Succubus's own blades never got the
//           [SUSTAINED HITS 1] her Storm of Blades hands the Wyches she is standing in.
//   leader  it is printed on the BODYGUARD unit's card and addresses the Character leading it
//           ("while a CHARACTER model is leading this unit, that model has Feel No Pain 4+")
// The two cross directions are why this is a separate resolver: every other record in this layer
// rewrites the card it was found on, and an ability is the first thing that can rewrite another.
//
// WARGEAR usually has one: it modifies its bearer, and only once the bearer actually took it —

// is the set of normalised item names this entry fields (rosterModifiers' loadoutItemIds resolved
// through the shared item table) — without it a Storm Shield's 4+ invulnerable would print on every
// model that could have taken one.
//
