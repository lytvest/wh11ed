// Roster modifier overlay — what a datasheet looks like for ONE roster entry, as opposed to the
// bare printed sheet. Pure functions, no Vue, no store (same discipline as rosterEngine.js /
// rosterValidation.js). See src/components/roster/CLAUDE.md ("Modifier overlay"); this file is
// Tier A: it trims the weapon tables to the loadout the entry actually fields (and states how
// many of each weapon that loadout holds), resolves the
// keywords the roster's detachments grant it, and reports the roster facts that aren't on the
// datasheet at all (Warlord, enhancement, attachment). `notes` stays empty until Phase B.
//
// GUIDING RULE (why this doesn't just "apply the rules"): 40k modifiers are overwhelmingly
// CONDITIONAL (a phase, a range, a target, an aura, once per battle), and wh40k-appdata carries
// almost none of them structurally — 961 enhancements yield 6 ability links and 2 weapon-profile
// links, everything else is prose. GW's own app doesn't recompute statlines either. So this layer
// only ever changes what it can derive STRUCTURALLY, and everything judgement-based is surfaced as
// an attributed note instead — the same "mark it, don't fake it" treatment DatasheetCard already
// gives rule-granted keywords via its `grantedKeywords` prop.
