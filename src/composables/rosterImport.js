// THE FORMATS (see rosterExport.js for the ones we write):
//   gw   the Warhammer 40,000 app's 11th-edition export — what a player has in their clipboard
//        after building a list in the app, and what tournament organisers ask for. listhammer.info
//        writes the SAME grammar in its detailed ("with wargear") mode, so one parser reads both;
//        the differences it tolerates rather than forks over are all cosmetic: capitalised
//        "Points", a thousands separator (2.000), `◦` for the weapons under a model line, plural
//        "Enhancements:", and a bare Force Disposition line where the app writes a labelled one.
//        The same site's plain-text mode is the same grammar again, with a LABELLED header
//        ("List Name:", "Factions Used:", "Army Points:", "Detachment(s):") closed by a row of
//        '+', section headings that end in a colon, and "pts" for "points".
//   listhammer-compact  the same site's short mode: one line per unit, attached units joined with
//        " + ", model counts, and no wargear. What shapes the import screen is what it does NOT
//        carry: no faction, no detachment and no battle size anywhere in the text, so the faction
//        has to be asked for. See parseListhammerCompact.
//   wtc  the tournament header format (New Recruit's "WTC" and its "NR-GW" sibling, which share
//        the `+++` header block).
//
// BEST-EFFORT, NEVER SILENT. A list is prose written by another program against another points
// file: names drift, weapons are spelled differently, a datasheet may not exist in our data at all.
// So every step reports what it could not place — `report.units[].gear.missing`, `report.missing`,
// and the points COMPUTED here beside the points the text STATED. A unit is never dropped quietly:
// what we failed to match is what the reader has to fix by hand, and they can only fix what they
// are shown.
//
// POINTS ARE NEVER TRUSTED FROM THE TEXT. They are recomputed from our own MFM data; the stated
// figure rides along only so the difference can be shown. A list exported against last month's
// points is not a bug in the import.
