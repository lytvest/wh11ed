// Which of YOUR units a rule's own text says it affects — the keyword layer that lets the roster
// overlay show a unit only the detachment/army rules that actually bear on it. Pure, no Vue.
//
// Rules almost always name their target in the prose ("Speed Freeks units from your army are
// eligible to…", "each time a friendly ADEPTUS CUSTODES TERMINATOR model…"), so the target is
// readable without any hand-authored sidecar — and reading it from the same string that gets
// rendered means the gate can never drift away from the text it gates, which a generated sidecar
// would eventually do.
//
// THE WHOLE DESIGN IS FAIL-OPEN. A gate that wrongly hides a rule is far worse than one that
// wrongly shows it: the reader loses a rule that applies to their unit and has no way to know.
// So there are three independent escapes, and any of them showing the rule wins:
//   1. A rule that says nothing about your own units at all is never gated.
//   2. If ANY passage that does talk about your units names no keyword ("Units from your army with
//      this ability…", "that unit", "models in that unit"), the whole rule is ungated — we only
//      gate what we understand end to end. This is what keeps multi-part rules honest: Aeldari's
//      Battle Focus names VEHICLE in one of its five triggers and nothing in the others, and
//      gating on that one word would hide it from every infantry unit in the army.
//   3. If no unit in the faction matches at all, the extraction is assumed wrong and ignored.
//
// Measured across all 30 factions (re-measured 2026-08-23, after teaching KW_ALT the comma/or/and
// list form): 227 of 268 detachment rules yield a scope, 38.7% of (unit, rule) pairs are hidden,
// no unit is left seeing none of its faction's rules, and 10 rules fall through escape 3 — prose
// that abbreviates a faction keyword ("Votann units" against the LEAGUES OF VOTANN keyword,
// "AGENTS OF IMPERIUM"), or a capitalised word that was never a keyword. Those 10 are shown to
// everyone, which for the army-wide ones is the right answer anyway. Re-run that measurement after
// touching the patterns; the numbers are the only way to tell a sharper gate from a wrongly-hiding
// one — and diff the per-rule VISIBLE UNIT SETS, not just the totals. The 2026-08-23 change moved
// 16 rules to more units (each one a rule that had been hiding from units it names) and two the
// other way: Skitarii Hunter Cohort and Cult of Blood named their targets in a list, matched no
// keyword end to end, and so had been shown to the whole army by escape 2.
//
// Re-measured 2026-09-19 (glossary links unwrapped, "friendly unengaged", the spaced-slash tail,
// Battle-shocked as a stop word): 300 rules, 11 changed — every one narrower, and every one a rule
// that had been shown to the whole faction because a [gloss:…] bracket sat between "friendly" and
// the keyword (all 4 Black Templars detachment rules, 3 T'au, 3 Space Marines) or because
// "unengaged" did (Purestrain Broodswarm). Stratagem TARGET lines are a different corpus with
// its own reader (rosterStatMods' stratagemTargetScopes): 1323 of 1329 read.
