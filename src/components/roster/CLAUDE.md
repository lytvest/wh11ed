# CLAUDE.md — Roster Builder

Directory-scoped doc for the army list builder (`/roster*`). Loaded contextually instead of
living in the monolithic `wh11ed/CLAUDE.md` — this feature's code is spread across a few
directories (below), so also read this file when touching `src/composables/roster*.js`,
`src/data/roster/`, or `src/views/tracker/Roster*.vue` even though they sit elsewhere.
`wh11ed/CLAUDE.md`'s Game Tracker section has a one-line pointer here; that's the only
mention of the roster builder in the root doc — don't duplicate this content back into it.

## What this is

Build/validate/export/share a 40k army list, then hand it off to the Game Tracker. Its own
top-level nav section (`meta: { section: 'roster' }` on every `/roster*` route in
`router/index.js`, `isRosterRoute` in `useRouteSection.js`) — a `Rosters`/«Ростеры» link
sits next to `Tracker` in the desktop navbar and the mobile drawer, and its own bottom-nav
icon sits right after `Rules`. No subnav (single-page section, like the Factions list).
Decoupled from Tracker on 2026-08-03 — it used to ride with that section (`meta.section:
'tracker'`, a `trackerGroups` entry, a card on `TrackerHomeView`); if you find a stray
`isTrackerRoute` check gating roster behavior, or a reference to a roster card on the tracker
home page, it's stale from before the split.

Routes: `/roster` (list), `/roster/new` (creation wizard), `/roster/:id` (editor),
`/roster/:id/view` (read-only), `/roster/shared` (import a shared link). `/roster/:id/add` was the
catalogue's own page and is now a **redirect** to the editor — kept for the links that outlive a
route (a stored last route, which the PWA resumes into; a back stack; a bookmark).

## Generated data layer

`scripts/gen-roster-data.mjs` (`npm run roster:data`), sourced from `wh40k-appdata` — same
class of derived data as the datasheet/mfm pipelines (structural facts only, no rules prose):

- `src/data/roster/core.js` — battle sizes (points / DP / enhancement+duplicate limits)
- `src/data/roster/<slug>.js` — one per faction, 30/30 generated, each carrying its own `allies`
  metadata (see **Allies** below). Units link to their
  datasheet page via `sourceIds.json`'s `ds:` entries (`linked: true` + id); unmatched units
  get a slugified id and no link. 1034/1034 units currently linked; 1 dropped for missing
  points/composition (Imperial Knights' Sir Hekhtur — check the generator's console output
  after a re-run for any new drops).
- `src/data/roster/items.js` — wargear item names + group instruction text, interned once
  across all factions (most wargear is a free swap; only ~83 options carry a points delta)
- `src/data/roster/index.js` — `loadRosterFaction(slug, { allies })`, lazy per-faction (`import.meta.glob`,
  same PWA-light-entry-chunk discipline as `data/datasheets/index.js`), folds an SM-Chapter's
  `sharedUnitIds` back in the same way `datasheets/index.js`'s `loadDatasheets` does, applying
  that Chapter's own `unitPoints` to the folded units (see Points below)
- Mutually-exclusive wargear groups (one group's pick depends on another group's, on the same
  datasheet+miniature) have no structural field in appdata linking them — the generator infers
  it; see the "deviation" comments in `gen-roster-data.mjs` around
  `base_miniature_loadout_wargear_option` before touching that logic.
- **`hosts`** — a BODYGUARD unit that may hold more than the one leader the core rules give it
  ("unless otherwise stated, each **bodyguard** unit can only have one **leader** unit and one
  **support** unit attached to it"). Five datasheets state otherwise **on their own side of the
  attachment**, which is why reading only the leaders' rules missed them: the four Astra Militarum
  squads that "can have up to two Leader units attached to it, provided no more than one of those
  units is a **COMMAND SQUAD** unit" (Cadian Shock Troops, Catachan Jungle Fighters, Death Korps of
  Krieg, Tempestus Scions — a Castellan AND a Command Squad on one squad is the ordinary way that
  army is built, and calling it illegal was our reading, not the game's), and Kroot Carnivores, who
  take two once twenty strong "provided those Leaders are not duplicates". appdata puts neither in
  a table — the AM clause is in the datasheet's `unitComposition` text, the Kroot one in a datasheet
  rule — so the generator reads the sentence with every qualifier it carries (`{ n, oneKw, noDup,
  minModels }`) and reports one whose qualifiers it recognised none of rather than taking it as "two
  leaders, no conditions". `hostLimitsFor` turns that into an allowance and `hostSlotTaken` answers
  the one question both the picker (`used`) and `manyLeaders` ask, so the editor can never offer
  what the validator refuses.
- **`flags.alongside`** — a leader that does NOT take the single Leader slot. The core rules read
  "unless otherwise stated, each **bodyguard** unit can only have one **leader** unit and one
  **support** unit attached to it", and six Death Guard datasheets state otherwise: "You can attach
  this model to a **PLAGUE MARINES** unit, even if one other Leader unit has already been attached
  to it (you cannot attach more than one of the same Leader to the same unit)" — the blob every
  Death Guard army is built around. appdata types them `leader` like anything else (its
  `bodyguardType` has no third value), so the editor's picker disabled the target for the second
  character and the validator called the army illegal. The generator reads the sentence out of
  `datasheet_rule` (`ALONGSIDE_RE`); `leaderOccupies` in rosterEngine and the `manyLeaders` key in
  rosterValidation both go through it, and the parenthetical is the only limit kept — not two of the
  SAME leader on one unit. Checked against the whole game: `bodyguardType` agrees with the rule's
  own name ("Leader"/"Support") on all 304 datasheets that have a group, so this is the one
  exception class, not a symptom of a wider typing problem.
- **`MIRROR_ATTACH`** — an attachment one datasheet borrows from another: "If a **CHARACTER** unit
  from your army with the Leader ability can be attached to an **INTERCESSOR SQUAD**, it can be
  attached to this unit instead." 33 datasheets carry a rule of that shape (Deathwing Terminator
  Squad, Sword Brethren, Death Company, Tankbustas, Sanctifiers…) and appdata writes most of the
  resulting links into its own bodyguard tables — but not all: **9** were missing, and each was an
  attachment the game allows and the editor refused (Mek → Breaka Boyz, Tech-Priest Enginseer →
  Servitor Battleclade / both Hastarii, four CAPTAINs → Victrix Honour Guard). Derived rather than
  listed by hand: the rule is parsed once, then applied inside `buildUnit` per faction bundle
  against the leads that unit actually has, at the type the borrowed attachment already had (a
  Support link stays Support). The clause before "can be attached to" is a restriction and is kept
  — a **CHAPLAIN** model, a **CAPTAIN** or **CHAPTER MASTER** unit, everyone but an EPIC HERO — and
  a rule whose source unit cannot be resolved is reported, not guessed at. Nothing is added where
  appdata already has the link, so the run report's list is exactly the gap.
- **`PROSE_ATTACH`** — two attachments appdata states in prose and in no table at all. The Ogryn
  Bodyguard and Nork Deddog "must join one **COMMAND SQUAD** unit from your army" (their Loyal
  Protector rule) and have no `datasheet_bodyguard_group` of any kind, so as generated they could
  join nothing: an army fielding one could not be built here, and a list holding one imported with
  the model standing alone. Written as the keyword group appdata would have used, `support` — a
  Command Squad is itself a Leader unit and its own Leader slot is a different thing, and the rule's
  own limit ("a COMMAND SQUAD cannot have more than one LOYAL PROTECTOR model joined to it") is then
  exactly what the per-type `manyLeaders` check already enforces. The generator prints a line for
  each and refuses to apply one the day appdata grows its own group: this is a stand-in for missing
  data, not an opinion about it.

**`npm run roster:data:check`** (`--check`, and part of `npm run sync`) regenerates everything in
memory and reports which files would change, writing nothing. Without it an appdata bump left the
largest generated surface of this feature quietly stale — every other generated sidecar in the repo
had a check and this one didn't.

### Two tables for one default loadout

appdata records what a model starts with twice: `base_miniature_loadout` (per model) and a
wargear_option_group whose instruction is literally "Default Wargear" (the totals the profile
fields). Most datasheets agree. Where they don't it is the ROW that is short — a Servitor
Battleclade's Gun Servitors carry a heavy bolter and a heavy arc rifle between them and the row
records neither, an Archon loses its Shadowfield, Coteaz his psyber-eagle — so the generator adds
whatever the group names and the row does not (9 items, 9 miniatures game-wide; the run prints each
one). The same disagreement is why `LOADOUT_ITEM_FIXES` exists for the Death Company Dreadnought.

The two tables also COUNT differently: a row is one model's, a group is the profile's total. So a
group's counts are **divided by the models that profile fields** (the two Crisis Starscythe Shas'ui
share "Burst cannon 2" — one each, as their datasheet says), and everything downstream reads one
convention: per model. Where the count does not divide it is a total and nothing else, and it keeps
the **third element**: `[itemId, count, 1]` (one of the two Gun Servitors has the heavy bolter, one
of two Sanctifiers Missionaries the plasma gun). `defaultLoadoutLines`, the points and the export
print or spend such an item as recorded instead of multiplying it.

Only 4 datasheets carried a count above 1 on a multi-model profile this way, but the reading matters
beyond display: the importer now compares COUNTS against the printed loadout (below), so a wrong
expectation is a phantom swap or a lost one.

### A Chapter's Codex detachments

A Blood Angels army may field Codex: Space Marines detachments as well as its own eight, and the
only place that entitlement is written down is appdata's `detachment_faction_keyword`: Blood
Angels, Dark Angels, Space Wolves and Deathwatch may take 16 of the Codex's 23, Black Templars 14
(no Librarius Conclave — they have no Librarians). `detachment_faction_detachment_points_cost`
then says what one costs THEM: Stormlance Task Force is 3 DP for a Codex army and 2 for Blood
Angels, Black Templars and Deathwatch.

The generator emits both per Chapter — `sharedDetachments` (names) and `detachmentDp` (the
overrides) — and `loadRosterFaction` folds the detachments in from space-marines.js at load time,
exactly as it already did for `sharedUnitIds`, marking each `shared: 1`. Until this landed the
editor offered a Blood Angels player their eight Chapter detachments and nothing else, so a Gladius
or Stormlance army — the commonest thing a Chapter fields — could be neither built nor imported.
The RULES side already handled it: `RosterViewView` and the stratagems page fall back to the
space-marines faction file for a detachment the Chapter's own file doesn't define.

### A group of nothing but defaults is a loadout

appdata records a miniature's starting gear as a `wargear_option_group` when there is no
`base_miniature_loadout` row — the instruction is literally "Default Wargear", 899 groups. Eight
more say the same thing in prose: "One other Navis Armsman is equipped with:", "Every other
Voidsman is equipped with:", the Tesseract Vault's "Powers of the C'tan", an Eradicator squad's
"Eradicator", and two datasheets that misspell the title ("Defualt Wargear", "Default Wargesr").
Matching on the TITLE read those eight as choices, so the Breachers' second armsman — who carries a
heavy shotgun AND an Endurant Shield AND a close combat weapon — became a group of three
alternatives capped at one, and a legal list came out illegal.

`isDefaultGroup()` therefore tests the SHAPE: **a group every option of which appdata marks as a
default (`defaultValue > 0`) is not a choice.** All three readers use it — `staticLoadout`, the
draft loop that builds the choices, and the name index the replaced-item prose resolves against.
That last one matters as much as the first: the Breachers' las-volley is named ONLY by such a
group, and forgetting it there left "1 Navis Armsman's Navis las-volley can be replaced with…"
replacing nothing. Six units' data changed, each of them gaining printed gear it had been offering
as a pick; `index.test.js` pins the Breachers and the Vault.

### A group capped by its own instruction

Pick limits come from appdata's `limited_wargear_choice_set` family (261 groups). Where appdata
records no set at all, the group's **instruction text** is the only statement of the allowance
there is — and it is often a real cap: *"This model can be equipped with up to two of the
following, but cannot take duplicates"* is what lets a Grand Master in Nemesis Dreadknight carry a
Sublimator AND a heavy psycannon (15 points each, and the list's own price says so). Without a cap,
`validateRoster` falls back to its conservative reading — one pick per model of that profile — and
called a legal two-weapon Dreadknight illegal.

`proseAllowance` (already used to cross-check appdata's own numbers) now also fills the gap: 108
groups gain a cap this way, never over one appdata itself gave, and only where the prose states a
plain number — it refuses "for every 5 models", "if this unit contains" and "any number of", which
are scaled or conditional and belong to the threshold table. "cannot take duplicates" becomes the
duplicate cap in the same entry.

**Two wordings state an allowance without naming a number** (added 2026-08-24), and both used to
fall through to the one-pick fallback:

- *"This model can be equipped with **any** of the following:"* — every option is on offer at once,
  one of each, so the list itself is the number (`limit = options, dup = 1`). One group corpus-wide,
  and it is the Battlewagon's: a grabbin' klaw AND a wreckin' ball is an ordinary build that the
  editor would not let you make and that came in from an export reported illegal.
- *"…can be replaced with **two different weapons** from the following list"* — the Devastator and
  Tactical Sergeants give up a bolt pistol and a boltgun, so it is two picks and never the same
  weapon twice. The Tactical Sergeant's *"1 twin lightning claws, **or** two different weapons"* is
  read as the same 2 — the exclusive "or" is not modelled, which allows one combination the rules
  don't; a cap that is one too wide is the tolerable direction here, one too tight is not.

Both read the FIRST line only, as every allowance does. "cannot take duplicates", by contrast, is
read from the whole text: it is usually a footnote under the list (two T'au groups keep their
duplicate cap only because of that). *"You cannot select the same option more than once"* is the
Raptors' spelling of the same rule (added 2026-09-19 — a player took two meltaguns from the group).

**The conditional form** (added 2026-09-19, `proseConditionalAllowance`) is the one `proseAllowance`
refuses: *"If this unit contains 10 models, up to 2 additional Raptors can each…"*, *"If this unit
contains 10 models, 1 Corsair Voidscarred's power sword can be replaced…"*, the block whose bullets
are each an allowance (Vespid Stingwings: three *"1 Vespid Stingwing can replace…"* bullets are three
models, `[[10, 3, 1]]`), and the Troupe's two blocks (*"9 or fewer models: up to two…"* /
*"10 or more: up to four…"* → `[[0, 4, 2], [10, 8, 4]]`). It is a step table — one row per block —
and below the first threshold the cap is a real 0, which the editor already says in words. Four
groups corpus-wide, all of which drew as a one-of radio offered at any size: a 10-model Raptor squad
could take one extra special weapon where the datasheet allows two, and a 5-model one could take it
at all. appdata's own set for the Raptors is one pool over BOTH groups (2 at any size, 4 at 10) and
matches both identically, so it is reported ambiguous and the prose is what remains.

The single-option *"Any number of models can each be equipped with 1 bio-plasma"* (Carnifexes, a
checkbox in appdata with nothing given up) is read as one per model too, like its multi-option
sibling below — it drew as one toggle for the unit, so two Carnifexes shared one bio-plasma. A
single-option SWAP in that wording stays `repall` (one tick reaching every model).

How to look for the next one of these: `scripts/` has no audit for it, but the shape is always
"prose implies more than one pick, group carries no `lim`, and the editor's `mode()` makes it a
radio or toggle" — dump every group without `lim`/`all`/`cp` whose first line has a number above
one, "each", "any number", "all models", "if this unit" or "for every", and read what is left after
dropping the bundled swaps ("2 X can be replaced with 2 Y" is one pick). The T'au *"any number of
models can each be equipped with up to two of the following"* (a per-MODEL budget `lim` cannot
express) is the known remainder — hub `journal/paused/2026-09-13-player-report-tails.md` §1.

### The stock rule: a weapon is given up once (added 2026-09-19)

A player found the Chaos Lord with Jump Pack taking a plasma pistol (for his bolt pistol), a power
fist (for his accursed weapon) AND twin lightning claws (for both) at once. The data knew better all
along — every one of those groups carries `rep`, what it replaces — but the only reader of `rep`
was the loadout line, which clipped the remainder at zero and said nothing. 98 profile/item pairs on
72 datasheets could be given up twice.

`rosterEngine.swapLedger` is now the one place that spends swaps, and three readers sit on it:

- **`swapsByMini`** (the loadout line, the modifier overlay, the export) — unchanged in meaning,
  GROSS: every model that took a swap gave up everything the group replaces, and the option's own
  grants are added by the reader.
- **`swapRoom(def, entry, gi, oi?)`** — how many models still carry every item a pick in this group
  would take, the group's own picks not counted. The editor greys an untouched group out through
  `wargearGroupBlocker` (`need: 'stock'`, "Already replaced by another choice: bolt pistol") and
  caps a stepper at the room the other groups left it. A group that already holds a pick is never
  closed: its pick is what the player would undo, and a greyed-out row cannot be undone.
- **`swapOverdraft`** — `{ id, used, cap }` per item given up by more models than carry it, which
  `validateRoster` reports as `overWargearReplaced`. Lists built before the rule, imported, or
  shrunk under their swaps land here; nothing is auto-trimmed.

Two readings keep legal lists legal. **Picks are summed per group before they meet the model
count**: the Devastator Sergeant's "bolt pistol and boltgun can be replaced with two different
weapons" is two rows in one group on one model, one allowance, not the pistol given up twice. **An
item the chosen option hands back is not given up** (`back`, the net half of the ledger):
Deathwatch Veterans trade "boltgun and power weapon" for "power weapon and Astartes shield", and
the Watch Sergeant who did so still holds a power weapon to trade for a xenophase blade — the GW app
builds him that way, and 13 corpus lists did. Room is therefore asked per OPTION where the options
differ in what they return.

Fail-open, as every other reader here: a per-copy group (`cp`), a unit whose models cannot be split
between profiles (`modelsPerMini` null), an item the profile's printed loadout does not carry (a
chained swap, an unresolved "X or Y") and a `total` line are not stock and never close anything.
Known residue: the importer breaks a tie between two same-named options (the two shield bundles)
by order, so one corpus list in 658 arrives with a Sergeant who swapped his power weapon twice and
is told so — the fix is one tap in the editor; a stock-aware tie-break is the importer's to grow.

### Attachments named by keyword

A datasheet can say who it joins with a keyword instead of a list — "this model can be attached to
any **IMPERIUM BATTLELINE INFANTRY** unit". The generator resolves those against the leader's own
faction AND emits the keywords themselves (`leadKw`), because a resolved id cannot travel: Inquisitor
Draxus allied into an Adeptus Mechanicus army joins a Skitarii Vanguard her own bundle has never
heard of. `rosterEngine.leadTypeFor` answers the question against the unit actually in the list, and
both the target picker and `leaderTargetInvalid` go through it.

### Points

**The brackets are appdata's, the prices are the Munitorum Field Manual's** (`src/data/mfm/*.js`,
scraped from the live list by `scripts/scrape-mfm.py` — the same source `sync-mfm-points.mjs` feeds
into the datasheet pages). Not a preference between two equal sources:

- appdata records **several parallel price rows per datasheet** — one per Chapter, and for Imperial
  Agents one per allied context. Mapped straight onto `sizes` they became unit-SIZE choices: two
  identical "5 models" pills at 80 and 75 points, the wrong one pre-selected. `pickPrices()` groups
  rows by what actually makes a bracket distinct (model range + `comp` — Corsair Voidscarred really
  does have three different 7-model builds) and collapses each group to one bracket. 79 rows
  collapse this way.
- Which of the parallel lists is this army's own? Where the MFM prices that size it says so
  outright; where it doesn't (Imperial Agents' "7-11 models") the row's **rank** decides, since the
  lists are parallel. Nothing is interpolated — a size the MFM doesn't price keeps an appdata
  number, just the one from the right list. The run names every such size, and the three units the
  MFM lists without a model count at all (Crusader Squad, Gretchin, Wolf Guard Headtakers, whose
  composition lives in a `note`), which keep appdata's prices — currently identical anyway.
- The copy tax stays appdata's `datasheet_points_step` (it knows WHICH copy the surcharge starts
  at, which the MFM only implies through its "1st-2nd"/"3rd+" notes); the generator cross-checks the
  surcharge those notes describe and reports a disagreement rather than shipping one.
- A shared Codex unit can cost a Chapter something else (Blood Angels' Bladeguard, everyone's
  Repulsor Executioner). Those 11 prices ride on the Chapter file as **`unitPoints`** — unit id →
  model count → points, only where they differ — and `loadRosterFaction` applies them to the folded
  units. Same fact, same source and the same numbers as `pointsOverrides` in
  `src/data/datasheets/<chapter>.js`; `index.test.js` pins the two together.

Before this the roster priced units from appdata alone and quoted a different number than the same
unit's own datasheet page — 30 brackets across 21 units, up to 35 points on Inquisitor Draxus.

**`LOADOUT_ITEM_FIXES`** is a named substitution table for a `base_miniature_loadout` row that
points at the wrong wargear item: appdata arms the Death Company Dreadnought with the BRUTALIS
Dreadnought's fists and bolt rifles, while its own printed loadout and its own swap instruction both
say blood fists. One entry today, applied only where the printed loadout and the option prose agree
against the table, and every application is printed by the run — a test pins the result so the table
gets dropped the moment upstream fixes the row.

### A default loadout that costs points (added 2026-08-24)

Since 11th edition the wargear a model **already has** can carry a price. appdata says so plainly —
a `wargear_option` with both `points: 5` and `defaultValue` — and the Munitorum bracket does not
include it: a Terminator Assault Squad is 310 for 6-10 models, and GW's own export prices ten of
them, thunder hammers and all, at **360**. Eleven such options over seven datasheets (Terminator
Assault Squad, Victrix Honour Guard, Ravager, Venatari Custodians, Achilles Ridgerunners, Crisis
Fireknife/Starscythe), and until this the roster read `wargear_option.points` only for options the
player PICKS, so all seven came out short.

It cannot be folded into the bracket: the bracket is flat from 6 to 10 models and the hammers are
not — a seven-model squad is 345. So it is a term of its own in `unitPoints()`:

- **`dw: [[miniIndex, points], …]`** on the unit — what one model of that profile pays for its
  printed loadout. Money per model, not items, because the awkward readings are all on the
  generator's side: a "Default Wargear" group counts the copies the whole profile fields where a
  `base_miniature_loadout` row counts one model's (`defaultsAreTotals` — the Starscythe's two
  Shas'ui carry one T'au flamer each, not two), and a count that doesn't divide among the models is
  reported and left uncharged rather than charged as a fraction.
- **`dr`** on a gear group — what one pick there gives back, since a model that trades the item away
  stops paying for it. Per COPY where the group is per-copy (`cp`), matching how the entry's count
  is stored: a Ravager's three dark lances are +5 each and go one at a time.
- `defaultWargearPoints()` multiplies `dw` by the models actually fielded (`modelsPerMini`), then
  subtracts the refunds. Where the bracket can't say how the models split between profiles it
  charges only if every profile costs the same — never a guess. The editor marks the total on the
  "Default wargear" heading (`+50pts`), because the size pill shows the Munitorum bracket and the
  difference would otherwise be invisible.

No option in the corpus is both priced and flagged default, so `unitWargearPoints()` and
`defaultWargearPoints()` cannot double-charge; the old `def`-flag branch that assumed otherwise is
gone.

### The Faction Pack Legends — units read from their own text (added 2026-09-19)

appdata carries Legends for the Orks only. The other 314 Legends datasheets live in
`src/data/datasheets/<slug>.js` with `source: 'faction-pack'`, transcribed from the Faction Pack
PDFs (hub skill `legends-from-pack`), and until 2026-09-19 the roster did not know them: nothing in
appdata's tables describes their profiles, loadouts or swaps. **`scripts/lib/pack-roster.mjs`** reads
the three printed fields instead and `gen-roster-data.mjs`'s `packUnitsFor` lists the result beside
the appdata units of the same faction file (a Chapter's file carries the Chapter's own pack sheets;
the Space Marines pack sheets reach a Chapter through `sharedUnitIds`, which the datasheet layer
folds them into since 2026-09-20 — see "SM-Chapter datasheet dedup" in `src/data/CLAUDE.md` for
which ones each Chapter is denied and why).

- **`composition`** → `minis` and `sizes`. "1 Biker Sergeant / 2-5 Space Marine Bikers / 0-1 Attack
  Bike" is three profiles; the MFM rows the sheet already carries (`sync-mfm-points`) become brackets
  the way the app reads them — a row prices every size above the previous row up to its own count.
  `comp` is emitted only where the profiles' ranges add up to the bracket exactly, as the appdata
  reader keeps it: a bracket spread over two open-ended profiles carries none and every reader falls
  back (the Deathwatch-team behaviour). A row the composition cannot hold ("1 model" on a squad of
  3–7, the MFM's add-on prices) is dropped and reported. "One of the following:" over two whole
  compositions (Death Korps Grenadier Squad) is folded into one range per profile, wider than the
  two legal builds, and said so.
- **`loadout`** → `defaults`. One paragraph per subject; "This/Every model" is every profile, a name
  is that profile (plural-blind, `pkey`: "Kill Team Intercessors with plasma incinerators" and its
  singular are one name; a named crew — Kill Team Cassius, Hell's Last — reaches its profile through
  the composition's aliases). A paragraph about ONE model ("One Nightmare Hulk", "1 Lesk's Hero"
  four times) is a profile TOTAL (the `[id, count, 1]` slot the Servitor Battleclade uses), not a
  per-model kit.
- **`options`** → `gear`. Every sentence resolves to WHO (a profile, or unit-wide), HOW MANY models
  (one → checkbox; up to N, N per 5, any number → stepper with the matching `lim`), WHAT is given up
  (`rep`, resolved against the profile's printed loadout — chained swaps and the pack's own
  misprints stay without one, fail-open) and the VALUE (a bullet list, "up to two of the
  following[, and can take duplicates]", "two different weapons from the following list" → limit 2
  / dup 1, an inline set "1 X and 2 Y" → a bundle). "Each of this model's X" → `cp`. "[not] equipped
  with X" → `cond` on the sibling that grants or gives X up (a bundle counts as granting). A
  generic "models" allowance that only one profile can make ("Up to 3 models can each have their
  storm bolter replaced…" where only the Terminators carry one) belongs to that profile. "The Assault
  Sergeant can do one of the following:" becomes one group per bullet, the later gated on the first.
- **Items** are interned BY NAME through `fx.itemByName`: the appdata item of that name where one
  exists (preferring one already interned), else a pack-only item under the printed spelling — so a
  Legends Bike Squad's bolt pistol is the same id every Space Marine carries and the importer, the
  stock rule and the export cannot tell the sources apart. Pack items are interned LAST (the faction
  files are written after every faction is built), so appdata's ids do not move when a pack sheet is
  added.
- **Leaders** by name against the faction's units (and the SM pool for a Chapter); a keyword target
  ("Imperium Battleline Infantry") becomes `leadKw` plus the resolved ids. **The Mark of Chaos** is
  granted by the Pactbound Zealots rule's own wording — a HERETIC ASTARTES unit, not an EPIC HERO,
  carrying no mark already — copied from an appdata unit that has it; 17 CSM sheets.
- **Fail-closed, reported by name.** The generator prints every sheet dropped, bracket rejected,
  loadout paragraph unplaced, option sentence unread, replaced item unresolved, item the sheet does
  not print, Leader target not found — under "Faction Pack Legends" in the run report. Read it after
  a pack sheet is added or re-transcribed; a new wording is a template to add to `parseOption`, not
  a note. Today: one sheet dropped (T'au Tactical Drones, no MFM price), 12 chained/misprinted `rep`s,
  the two `"with:"`-style Kill Team leftovers all read.
- **RU** for the new instruction wordings is the same generated layer (`npm run roster:texts-ru`),
  extended the same day: footnote lines are split off and translated where known (the Armoury card
  sentence, "Maximum one per model"…), and a dozen frames were added for the pack's phrasings. 290/290
  pack instructions translate.

### Reading a swap that only shows as a count (added 2026-08-24)

An export prints what the models are HOLDING, not what changed. `matchRoster` used to call a weapon
a pick when its name was not in the printed loadout — which is blind to the commonest T'au swap
shape: a Crisis Fireknife starts with a plasma rifle AND a missile pod and can trade either for the
other, so "2x Missile pod" on a Shas'vre is a swap and a squad with no missile pods at all is three
of them. Both read as "nothing to see". Three swaps, 15 points, on a unit that also pays for the
pod it starts with.

So the printed loadout is now spent by COUNT: it absorbs the first N copies of each item and only
the surplus is a pick. The stock is kept twice — per profile (so a weapon named under a profile
prefers that profile's groups) and unit-wide, both drawn from together, because a datasheet can
field several profiles under one NAME (an Aquila Kill Team lists four "Deathwatch Veteran"s, each
with its own loadout) and the name is all the export gives. Where the models cannot be split between
profiles at all (`modelsPerMini` returns null — the Deathwatch kill teams) the printed loadout
absorbs whatever the count, exactly as it read before.

Two guards keep this from blaming the list for our data:

- A surplus of a printed item that NO option on the datasheet grants is absorbed silently, not
  reported as unmatched wargear: appdata gives a Defiler one excruciator cannon where its own
  loadout text and the model both say two.
- Steppers are read as the editor reads them (`UnitEditorFields`' `mode()`): a group whose CAP
  allows several picks is a stepper whatever appdata calls its input, and when a weapon still has
  copies to place, a group with room takes them before one that is already full. A T'au Commander's
  "up to three of the following, and can take duplicates" is a checkbox with a cap of 3; counted as
  one pick per copy, his second and third missile pods spilled into the group that replaces his
  burst cannon — a second pick in a group that allows one, so a legal Commander imported as an
  illegal one.

## Allies (added 2026-08-24)

An army can hold units that do not have its Faction keyword. **All 21 allied contexts appdata
records are supported**, and none of them is hand-written: `allied_faction` plus six satellite
tables say which armies may take a group, which datasheets it offers, the per-keyword caps per
battle size, the combined points ceiling, and which Detachment (if any) unlocks it.

`gen-roster-data.mjs` emits that per faction as **`allies`** — metadata only (ids + limits), so a
faction file stays one chunk. Two shapes, and the difference is visible in the ids:

- **cross-faction** — the units live in another bundle, so their ids are **namespaced**
  `<source slug>:<unit id>` (`imperial-agents:inquisitor-draxus`). A bare id is only unique within
  a bundle — Astra Militarum and Imperial Agents each have a `ministorum-priest`, and an AM army
  can ally the Agents one — and the prefix is also how the runtime knows which bundle to load and
  which faction's datasheet page the unit links to. One group can mix sources (the Chaos Space
  Marines' cult-legion group takes one datasheet from each of the four cult legions), so the source
  is per id, never per group.
- **in-bundle** (appdata's `isSiblingFaction`, plus Drukhari's Harlequins) — already in this
  faction's file (Blood Legions in `world-eaters.js`). Bare ids; the group exists only to carry the
  limits that apply to them.

`loadRosterFaction(slug, { allies })` merges the cross-faction ones on request, keeping the
namespaced id as the unit's id. **Opt-in on purpose**: an IMPERIUM army reaches three bundles it
otherwise never loads, so the editor and the import screen ask for them always and the read-only
screens only when the list actually holds one (`usesAllies`). No new files ship — the source
bundles already existed.

**Prices are the allied ones** where the MFM prints a second list: the `up` map on a group is the
same mechanism as a Chapter's `unitPoints` (model count → points, only where it differs). Draxus is
75 points in her own army and 110 in somebody else's.

**What the runtime adds to the data.** `validateRoster` applies the Detachment gate (`allyLocked`),
the per-keyword caps (`allyOverLimit`), the either/or of the Knight and Titan rules — "either one
TITANIC model or up to three ARMIGER models", appdata's `isMutuallyExclusiveKeywordLimit`, emitted
as `mutex` (`allyMutex`) — and the points ceiling (`allyOverPoints`). On top of that it applies the
sentence every CROSS-FACTION allied rule ends with and which no table records: *"None of these
models can be your WARLORD, and they cannot be given Enhancements"* (`allyWarlord`, `allyEnh`).
**In-bundle groups are deliberately spared that pair** — Aeldari's Harlequins rule has no such
clause, and Ynnari units are exactly what the Devoted of Ynnead Detachment's Enhancements are for.
`canTakeEnhancements` is appdata's own field (`enh`) and overrides the ban where it is set.

**A detachment can bar another faction's datasheet.** `excludedUnits` ids are namespaced the same
way allied ids are, because the fallback used to be the slugified NAME and two factions can print
the same one. Black Spear Task Force bars the **Codex: Imperial Agents** Watch Master, Corvus
Blackstar, Watch Captain Artemis and Deathwatch Kill Team — the allied copies you would otherwise
bring alongside your own — and by name those became the **Index: Deathwatch** datasheets the army is
built around, so every Deathwatch list holding a perfectly legal Watch Master read as illegal. Four
ids across the game are foreign; the rest stay bare, including the Codex: Space Marines squads a
Chapter folds into its own pool.

**One group, two rules.** An army can be offered the same allied faction by two rows — Deathwatch
gets the general Agents of the Imperium list (written for ADEPTUS ASTARTES) and its own, which is
that list minus the five Deathwatch datasheets its own bundle already carries. The generator keeps
the rule written closest to this army (the taker naming the faction itself beats one naming a
parent) and reports the drop; otherwise the group would be capped twice and printed twice.

**Which group a unit counts against is decided by the Detachment, not by the user.** Drukhari can
reach the same Troupe through two groups — Harlequins under Reaper's Wager (500 pts, Enhancements
allowed) and the corsair group under eight other Detachments (250 pts) — and they can never be
active at once, which is what makes `allyGroupOf` well-defined.

**On screen**, allies are their own sections rather than battlefield-role entries
(`rosterEngine.sectionsOf`, shared by the catalogue, the editor and the read-only view):
the browser prints the group's ceiling next to its name and does not offer a group whose Detachment
isn't selected, while the editor and the view keep a locked group visible (`keepLocked`) so a unit
that is in the list can't disappear from the screen while still counting in the total. The GW export
prints them under **ALLIED UNITS** — the app's own heading, which our importer already read, so an
exported list comes back whole. Attached allies stay inside their `Attached Unit` block, as the app
prints them.

**Import**: allied units resolve by name like any other, but the army's OWN datasheet always wins a
name collision — an Astra Militarum list saying "Ministorum Priest" means its own.

**Known gap — the modifier overlay is army-only.** `RosterViewView` now loads each ally faction's
datasheets (and its RU overlay), so an allied row has its statline, keywords and ability text like
any other. What it does not load is that faction's `rosterModifiers` records, which are matched by
bare unit id against one `factionEn` bundle: merging a second faction's records would need a second
rule-body source and a scoping story for records that address "your army". So an allied unit shows
its base statline and no Tier-C chips of its own. Its printed card is unaffected —
`RosterUnitRulesModal` is given the ally's own slug and bare id and loads that faction itself.

## The army's Force Disposition (added 2026-08-28)

The card a player selects after mustering: the opponent's symbol on it names their Primary Mission
(`eventCompanion.js` holds the 5×5 matrix). It is a property of the DETACHMENT — `fd` on every one
of the 268 — and of the ARMY there is exactly one, so a list fielding several detachments that
disagree has to **declare** which it plays. Until this landed the builder said nothing about it at
all: the picker showed each detachment's disposition while choosing and the answer vanished the
moment the modal closed.

- **`roster.disposition`** holds the declaration, spelled as `fd` spells it. Not the tracker's own
  id: that vocabulary lives in the Event Companion data, which these screens deliberately never
  load, and `rosterHandoff` — the one place both are in scope — translates. No `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  bump (an absent field is simply undeclared) and no backend change (`domain/roster.ts` passes
  unknown keys through).
- **`dispositionCandidates` / `dispositionOf`** (`rosterEngine.js`) are the only readers. One
  candidate answers for itself and nothing is stored; several make the stored declaration the
  answer, and only while it still names a candidate — so dropping the detachment a declaration came
  from takes the declaration with it, and a list can never claim a disposition it does not field.
- **The screens ask it the way the tracker's own setup does** — the label switches to «Заявленная»
  when there is a choice, the candidates are a `.seg`, a single one is stated read-only, and with
  no detachment the field says what to pick first. The wizard's step 1 and the editor's Setup tab
  each carry it beside the detachment they follow from.
- **`validateRoster` warns** (`dispositionUndeclared`, naming the candidates) rather than choosing
  for the player — the same never-block rule as everything else here.
- Downstream, everyone reads the one answer: the GW export's own line and the WTC header's
  parenthetical, the printed sheet's header facts, and the tracker draft `prefillDraftFromRoster`
  writes (so "play this list" arrives with the declaration already made instead of the tracker
  silently taking whichever candidate its data lists first). `rosterShare`'s `PICK` carries it, so
  a shared link and a game snapshot keep it.
- **The importer reads it back**, from the GW `Force Dispositions:` line, listhammer's labelled
  `Disposition:` field and the WTC detachment line's parenthetical — but only when the text names
  ONE. A list of candidates is not a declaration, and a name none of the matched detachments offers
  is ignored by `dispositionOf` rather than shown.

## Shared derivations (`src/composables/useRosterDerived.js`)

Everything four screens read OFF a roster once its faction data is in: `unitMap`/`defOf`,
`curDetachments` (the roster stores detachment NAMES; these are the objects), `effBattle`/`limit`,
`points`, `entryMeta` (per-entry points + copy index), `groupedUnits` (`sectionsOf` with the
options every list screen uses), `attachRole`, `slugFor`, `dupCounts`/`dupBlocked`, `validation`
and `fieldProps`.

**It exists because those four had four copies of the same dozen lines.** They are not four
different questions — a roster costs what it costs whichever screen is showing it — and the copies
had already drifted once (the wizard's own `removeUnit` forgot to detach a Leader from the unit
leaving the list, which is what `useRosterEditing` was written to stop). Every later fix to
pricing or sectioning had to be made in three places or it silently wasn't.

**Over refs, not over an id.** The wizard's roster does not exist as a stored object until a
faction is picked and the print sheet is handed one through props, so both assemble a computed of
the same shape (`{ faction, detachments, battleSize, customPoints, checkLegality, units }`) and
hand it over. `useRosterEditing.js` is the wrapper for the one case that does own an id.

**Reads only.** Nothing in it writes to the roster, which is what lets a screen call it for a list
it does not own — the print sheet, the game's snapshot.

Its consumers and what each takes: `RosterEditorView` (through `useRosterEditing`),
`RosterCreateView` (its assembled draft), `RosterViewView` (the store's roster or the game's
snapshot), `RosterPrintSheet` (its props, renaming `curDetachments` to `dataDetachments` because
that component also takes a `detachments` PROP carrying the PROSE ones).

The faction ACCENT went the same way — `useFactionAccent.js`, a slug in and `--fa-light`/`--fa-dark`
out, shared by the three roster screens and `FactionAccentScope`. What `--accent` means inside each
screen stays that screen's scoped CSS; only the lookup is shared.

## Pure logic (`src/composables/roster*.js`)

No Vue, no store — testable without mounting anything. Not colocated with this component
directory; still part of this feature:

- `rosterEngine.js` — unit grouping (`UNIT_GROUPS`: epic/characters/battleline/transports/
  other, derived from keywords), points math, leader/warlord/enhancement eligibility, wargear
  group live-state
- `rosterSummary.js` — the cached `{ points, unitCount, issues }` denormalised onto each stored
  roster, who writes it and the repair pass for rosters nobody did (see **Store** below)
- `rosterValidation.js` — `validateRoster()`. Philosophy: **never block**, like the official
  app — always compute a total and surface `{ code, level: 'error'|'warn', uid?, params? }`
  issues for the user to judge rather than preventing an illegal list. `code` maps to an i18n
  message rendered by `RosterIssuesModal`.
  **An issue tied to an entry always names it.** The templates cannot do that for themselves — one
  code is raised from several places and some carry no unit at all — so `add()` fills `params.unit`
  for anything with a `uid`, and every unit-scoped message leaves room for it (`{unit}`; the
  attachment ones also get `{target}`, the unit at the other end). A name the roster holds more than
  once carries that entry's number in the list (`Cadian Castellan (2)`), which is the only thing
  telling three identical messages apart, and `RosterIssuesModal` renders the row as a link only
  when there is a unit to jump to. `rosterValidation.test.js` guards both halves: every issue with a
  `uid` has a `unit`, and no message asks for a placeholder the validator does not send.
  Per-unit duplicate cap: the battle size's limit,
  doubled for Battleline/Dedicated Transport, hard-capped at 1 for every Epic Hero regardless
  of battle size (rule 25).
  **Battleline gained from a Detachment counts, and only in an army that fields that Detachment**
  (fixed 2026-09-02, reported by a player against Codex: Orks — "battleline is broken, it lets you
  cram everyone in"). 29 datasheets in 15 factions carry the generated `condBattleline` flag, which
  says only that a datasheet CAN be Battleline and names no Detachment; read as the answer, it
  handed all 29 a permanent ×2 — six Warbikers in a Blitz Brigade list, six Poxwalkers outside
  Shamblerot Vectorium, and an Outrider Squad doubled in a plain Space Marines army for a keyword
  that belongs to Dark Angels' Company of Hunters. The gate that knows which Detachment grants it
  is `conditionalKeywords.json`, the same sidecar enhancement and Warlord eligibility already run
  through, so `isBattlelineNow(def, granted)` in `rosterEngine.js` is now the one answer and
  `duplicateLimit`/`bucketOf` both take it. **Every caller that holds the roster's detachments must
  pass them** — validateRoster, the catalogue's "+", both editors' copy buttons, `sectionsOf` and
  the export; a caller that passes nothing gets the old ungated reading on purpose, so a forgotten
  argument errs toward allowing a legal list rather than blocking one. `index.test.js` pins both
  halves against the real Orks bundle and checks that every flagged datasheet has a grant to gate
  on — a flag with no sidecar entry would silently lose the ×2 where it is deserved.
  **Every question it asks about a unit must be asked the way the EDITOR asks it** — about the
  ENTRY, not the printed datasheet. `enhIneligible` reads `enhEligible(e, def, granted)` with the
  keywords the entry has but its datasheet does not print, and both it and `enhOptionsFor` get them
  from one helper, **`grantedKeywords(def, entry, detachments, factionSlug)`** in `rosterEngine.js`,
  so the two cannot answer differently. It merges the two sources:
  - the keyword an **allegiance upgrade** handed the entry — without it the editor offered Honoured
    Fallen to a Telemon Dreadnought and this file called the same list illegal;
  - the keyword a **detachment rule** grants a named datasheet (`conditionalKeywords.json`, the same
    sidecar the datasheet page reads, gated here on the roster's own detachments — added
    2026-08-24). Rollin' Deff makes a Battlewagon, a Hunta Rig and a Kill Rig **WAGON**, and "Wagon
    unit only" is what Boarding Ramps asks for. No Ork datasheet PRINTS that keyword, so every
    upgrade in that detachment was ineligible for every unit in the game — 129 unit×enhancement
    pairs across 5 factions were, including Chaos Daemons' whole Shadow Legion (its four
    enhancements all require the SHADOW LEGION keyword the detachment itself grants), and a legal
    Orks list came back with an error on each Kill Rig carrying one. Nothing lost eligibility.
    `factionSlug` is what the sidecar is keyed by, which is why `enhOptionsFor` takes it as a fifth
    argument and both editors pass it. `warlordIneligible` reads the same
  keyword for the same reason (`canBeWarlord(def, detachments, granted)`, and both editors pass it
  too): Houndpack Lance's "select three WAR DOG units; those units have the CHARACTER keyword" makes
  a War Dog Karnivore a Character in every sense the rules use the word, the nomination of a Warlord
  included. A unit BARRED from the title (`noWarlord`) stays barred — the grant adds a keyword, it
  does not overrule a rule written about that datasheet.
  **A rule that says "must be your WARLORD" does not say "only one such unit".** The Muster step
  (`src/data/muster.js`) spells it out: *"Some units have a rule on their datasheet stating that
  they must be your WARLORD. If you want to include one or more of these units in your army, you
  must select one of them to be your WARLORD."* So Belisarius Cawl beside Thulia Ghuld is a legal
  Adeptus Mechanicus list — `supremeCommanderPick` asks for the choice when none of them wears the
  title, and the old `supremeCommanderConflict`, which called that pairing unresolvable, is gone.
  The lesson is the general one: when appdata's per-datasheet text looks contradictory, the core
  rules this app already ships usually settle it.
  `unknownUnit` is the one issue about the DATA rather than the list: a roster outlives the
  generated files it was built against, and an id that no longer resolves is filtered out by every
  other reader (the grouped lists, the export, the points), so the unit used to vanish and the army
  to get quietly cheaper.
- `rosterExport.js` — plain-text army list export in **three** shapes (`EXPORT_FORMATS`), EN names
  throughout (unit/detachment/wargear names stay English by project convention):
  - **`gw`** (default) — the Warhammer 40,000 app's own **11th-edition** export, which is what a TO
    asks for and what every list reader (BCP, New Recruit, 40kCompactor) parses first. It is not the
    10th's: several detachments at once with the battle size's **Detachment Points budget**, a
    **Force Dispositions** line — the one the army DECLARED (see below), falling back to the
    candidates while nobody has, so the line states an open choice rather than vanishing — and
    attached units as `Attached Unit N` blocks with `• Attached as: Leader (Character)` /
    `Bodyguard (Battleline)` — the character no longer carries a "leading" note. Sections are the
    app's three (`CHARACTERS`, `DEDICATED TRANSPORTS`, `OTHER DATASHEETS`); battleline has no
    heading of its own.
  - **`wtc`** — the tournament header format (New Recruit calls it WTC): a `+ KEY: value` block
    between `+++` bars, characters numbered `Char1…` so `+ WARLORD:` and `+ ENHANCEMENT:` can point
    at one, then a line per unit with its wargear inline, plus an indented `Attached to <unit>`
    line — the format's own way of stating an attachment, and what keeps a leader attached through
    a round trip.
  - **`wtc-compact`** — the same list with the per-profile bullets folded into the unit's own line.
    It is not a different grammar (the readers in circulation parse both with one parser), just a
    shorter body: a squad is one line instead of three.
  - **`compact`** — ours, one line per unit for a chat message; identical entries collapse to `2x`
    with their points **summed**, so the copy surcharge stays visible. The shortest thing here, at
    the price of being the one format nobody else parses.

  **Weapons come out as totals per model profile**, swaps already spent — `loadoutGroups()` reuses
  the same `modelsPerMini`/`swapsByMini` accounting the editor shows on screen, so the export prints
  the whole fielded loadout rather than only what the player changed. A datasheet with no recorded
  `defaults` falls back to the picks alone, which is the honest answer: we hold the roster bundle,
  not the datasheet.

  **The footer says `Exported with wh-rules.ru`, never the app's own `Exported with App Version:`.**
  Copying a layout is fine; signing somebody else's name to it is not — and a reader is entitled to
  know which tool and which points data (`APP_DATA_VERSION`) wrote the list.
- `rosterImport.js` — the way back in: read a list somebody else's tool wrote (`detectFormat` →
  `parseList` → `matchFaction` → `matchRoster`), in the formats `rosterExport.js` writes — the GW
  app's 11th-edition export and the WTC/New Recruit header format — plus **all three listhammer.info
  modes** (added 2026-08-24). `RosterImportModal.vue`
  (from the roster list's "Import" button) shows the report and only then creates the list, landing
  the reader in the EDITOR, because whatever failed to match is theirs to finish.

  **Best-effort, never silent.** A list is prose written by another program against another points
  file, so everything that could not be placed is named: units missing from our data, a detachment
  we don't have, wargear that matched no option. A unit is never dropped quietly — what is not shown
  cannot be fixed by hand.

  **Points are recomputed, never trusted.** `report.points` carries three numbers: what the list
  STATED in its header, what its matched units stated (`statedUnits`), and what those units cost
  HERE. A difference is normally a data-version difference, and saying so is the whole reason the
  stated figure is kept. The screen also NAMES the units behind it (`repriced`): a 2000-point list
  is fifteen units, and "50 points short" is only checkable once it reads "Terminator Assault Squad
  (310 / 360)" — an Imperial Fists export from data v913, priced before MFM v1.2.

  Two parsing details that took a real export to find:
  - **The bullet, not the indent, tells a model line from a weapon.** `  • 2x Chaos Spawn` with
    `    • 2x Hideous mutations` under it is a model group; `  • 1x Gorechild` with `    1x Plasma
    pistol` under it is one model carrying two weapons. Both indent identically — the deeper line's
    BULLET is the only difference, and reading it wrong doubles a unit's model count.
  - **A weapon belongs to the profile it was printed under.** The sergeant and the squad often have
    a group each offering the same weapon; `miniIndexOf` matches the model line's name against
    `def.minis` so the pick lands in the right group and prices the unit correctly. The same option
    named once per profile is merged into ONE pick — two triples would charge for it twice.

  **The WTC family is read by ONE tolerant parser**, because New Recruit's plain and compact exports
  differ only in how much of the body they spell out. It accepts `•` and `*` bullets, `pts` /
  `points` / `pt`, a quantity with or without its `x`, any `Char1:` / `Infa6:`-style reference
  prefix, and indented `9 with Bolt pistol, Chainsword` detail lines — where the leading number
  counts MODELS, so each item it lists is carried that many times over. The `+++` header is read as
  a SOURCE, not a summary: a compact export often states an enhancement only there, and the warlord
  only by its `Char1:` reference.

  **A WTC header can sit over somebody else's body.** listhammer re-exports a New Recruit list that
  way: the `+++` block on top, the army printed in listhammer's own grammar underneath — "Attached
  Unit 1" blocks, section headings, "Attached as:" lines, and bullets that mix model lines with
  weapons. Read as WTC (where every bullet IS a profile) a ten-model Death Company came out as 31
  models at half price, and the attachments were lost with them. `parseWtc` therefore looks at the
  body: GW markers in it (`Attached Unit N`, a section heading) mean the body is `parseGw`'s, and
  only the header — faction, detachment, warlord, enhancements — is read as WTC. Both paths end in
  `fromHeader()`, which is what applies the header's warlord and enhancements to the units.

  **An attachment is a line, and either side can carry it** (`Attached to <unit>`, and the character's
  own `Leading <unit>` / `Supporting <unit>`), so the matcher makes the CHARACTER of the pair the
  leader whichever way round it was written. Two details of that line, both of which used to lose
  attachments outright:

  - **The lines accumulate** (`attachedTo` is a LIST). A mob holds a Leader and a Support at once,
    and a listhammer export states each of them on its own line — reading one per unit kept only
    the last, so a Boyz mob with Ghazghkull and a Bannernob came in with one of them.
  - **The target may be indexed**: `Attached to Warboss[2]` is the SECOND Warboss the list prints.
    An army fielding three of a datasheet writes nothing else to tell them apart, and without the
    index every line resolved to whichever copy was stored last — one mob with three characters on
    it and two mobs alone. `rowsOf` keeps the rows in list order for that.

  **listhammer.info's detailed mode is the GW app's grammar**, so it goes through the same parser
  rather than a fork of it. Everything that differs is cosmetic and is tolerated in one place each:
  capitalised `Points`, a thousands separator (`2.000 Points` — points are integers, so a dot inside
  one is never a decimal point), `◦` for the weapons under a model line (added to `BULLET`, which is
  what the nesting rule reads), lower-case `Attached unit 1`, plural `Enhancements:`, and a bare
  Force Disposition line where the app writes a labelled one — **which is why the faction is the
  FIRST bare line and not the last**, or the army comes out as "Take and Hold".

  **Its plain-text mode is that grammar again with a LABELLED header**, and goes through the same
  parser too. `List Name:`, `Factions Used:`, `Army Points:`, `Detachment(s):` — read from their
  labels, which is strictly better than inferring them: read as bare lines, the title came out as
  "List Name: All Dogs go to Heaven" and the faction as the whole "Factions Used: Chaos Knights,
  Heretic Astartes" line, which matches no army at all (the army's own faction is the first name on
  that line; the rest are its allies). The header closes with a row of `+` — not the WTC `+++`
  block, which is told apart by its `+ FACTION KEYWORD:` lines — after which section headings end in
  a colon (`BATTLELINE:`), so `SECTIONS` tolerates one; without that, `OTHER DATASHEETS:` was read
  as a weapon of the unit above it. Points are abbreviated (`140 pts`), which is now written once as
  `PTS` and shared with the WTC parser and with `detectFormat` — before that the format was not
  detected at all and the import simply refused the list.

  Two more things this mode does inside a unit's body:
  - **It names a profile more briefly than appdata does, and folds the loadout into the name**:
    "9x Cultist w/ autopistol and brutal assault weapon" for a CHAOS CULTIST, "Beastman" for a
    FELLGOR BEASTMEN. Only the champion answered `isModel`, so a ten-model mob came out as one model
    — priced right by luck, since one is below the smallest bracket and falls back to it, but a
    20-Cultist mob would have been charged as 10. `fitsBracket` is the guard: **a count no bracket
    allows is not a count**, and only then are the lines the datasheet cannot place as WARGEAR read
    as models instead — and only if THAT count fits a bracket. A line we merely failed to understand
    still changes nothing, and a unit whose models we did read is never touched (which is what keeps
    "1x Ammo Runt" beside "9x Flash Git" from becoming a tenth model).
  - **The allegiance keyword is printed as if it were wargear.** "• Houndpack Lance Character" is
    the entry's `alleg` choice, with no label to tell it from a weapon (the app writes "Mark of
    Chaos: Khorne", which `parseGw` reads at parse time). `matchRoster` recognises it against what
    the datasheet offers — `def.alleg`'s own name, its detachment's name, and the option — and moves
    it out of the wargear. Getting this wrong cost the list five errors, not one: without CHARACTER
    the three enhancements were ineligible, the allegiance group was under its minimum, and the
    Warlord was "not a Character".

  **`listhammer-compact` is its short mode and needs its own parser.** One line per unit, an
  attached unit written as its members joined with `" + "` (leaders first, the unit they joined
  last — the Bodyguard/Leader/Support roles are reconstructed from that order), counts in MODELS,
  and an `Enhancement:` line under the group rather than beside the unit that carries it. It is
  detected by what it LACKS — nothing bulleted, only the header priced — because its footer is the
  only marker and nobody is obliged to paste it. It carries **no faction, no detachment and no
  battle size at all**, so `RosterImportModal` asks for the faction (a plain `<select>` off the
  light `factionsIndex`, not the tracker's picker, which would drag `mfmFactions` into the roster
  list's chunk) and says plainly that enhancements cannot be placed until a detachment is chosen.

  **The same header, FENCED (added 2026-08-24).** The site also writes that labelled header between
  two identical rows of `+`, and closing on the first one lost everything below it: the title read
  "List Name: …" and the army had no points, no faction and no detachment — and with no detachment
  its enhancement was rejected as one this army cannot take, so a 1995-point list came out at 1960
  with a "no detachment" warning against it. A row of `+` now closes the header only once a
  labelled field has been read; before that it is the fence OPENING it.

  Two more things that mode does, both about the block that says who joined whom:
  - **The block is headed by its members' names joined with `" + "` and the pair's total** ("Master
    of Executions + Khorne Berzerkers (265 pts)"), under an `ATTACHED UNITS:` heading that carries
    the colon the app's own heading does not — so neither the heading nor the block header was
    recognised, the header lines came out as four datasheets nobody could find, and the eight units
    under them stood alone. The header line opens a block instead of becoming a unit; its points are
    the pair's and are never counted. The members carry no "Attached as:" labels either, which is
    the unlabelled case `matchRoster` already resolves from the datasheets themselves.
  - **`w/` folds a model's loadout into its name on a MODEL line**: "Jakhal w/ mauler chainblade",
    "2x Khorne Berzerker w/ eviscerator and plasma pistol". The head names the profile and the
    loadout is printed again on its own lines underneath, so `profileHead` cuts it off for both
    `isModel` and `miniIndexOf`; without it those models went uncounted and a ten-model Jakhal pack
    came out as eight. (The plain-text mode does this too — see `fitsBracket` above — but there the
    arithmetic guard was all that rescued the count, and it only fires when the count is impossible.)

  Left unread in that mode: it restates a wargear group's STATE as a line of its own ("2 Hades
  autocannons" above the "2x Hades autocannon" it expands to, "1 mauler chainblade, 7 chainblades"
  above the models). Those lines name no option and no item, so they are reported as wargear that
  could not be placed — the honest answer for a line we do not understand. A rule for telling a
  restatement from real wargear by its SHAPE (a count written without its `x`, a comma) would also
  drop something a list might mean.

  One shape of it does have a safe rule, added 2026-08-24: **the composite loadout name**, "2x
  Cyclone Missile Launcher & Storm Bolter" above its own "2x Cyclone missile launcher" and "2x Storm
  bolter", "Bolt Rifle w/ Grenade Launcher", "Ectoplasma cannon and claws". `restates` in
  `matchRoster` drops one only when **every half is also named on its own line in the same unit** —
  then it is a restatement and the items are already counted. Not by shape, which is what makes it
  safe: a composite standing ALONE stays reported, because it is then the only statement of that
  loadout there is and we did fail to place it. And it is dropped, never re-fed as its halves —
  those halves are already in the list, so counting them again turned two cyclone missile launchers
  into four and had the squad take a swap it is not entitled to. Three such lines on one Space
  Marines list whose every point, pick and model count was right.

  More things real lists turned up, none of them about how an export spells things:
  - **The faction is the bare line that ANSWERS as one**, not the second line down. A list name runs
    to as many lines as the player is funny ("Meta? Never Heard of Her." over five lines, with its
    points on a line of their own), and the Force Disposition is a bare line too. `parseGw` collects
    every bare line and picks the one `isFactionName` — then `matchFaction` — recognises; nothing
    answering leaves it empty, which the import screen turns into "choose the faction". The **last**
    such line, because a Chapter is printed under its parent ("Space Marines" then "Dark Angels")
    and the Chapter is the army — taking the first gave a Dark Angels list the Space Marines bundle,
    which has no Azrael, no Deathwing Knights and neither of that list's detachments.
  - **A Chapter with no book of its own is still what the export names** (added 2026-08-24).
    "Factions Used: Raven Guard, Adeptus Astartes" answered nothing at all, and a list whose faction
    does not resolve imports as NOTHING — every unit in it is looked up against that faction's data.
    `matchFaction` now reads each comma-separated part in turn: our own faction names first, then
    the six Chapters `space-marines.js` lists as its `chapters` (the five with their own book are
    factions here already and match by name), and last, only if nothing else spoke, the bare
    `Adeptus Astartes` keyword — a guess, but it is the codex of that name, WTC states it alone
    ("FACTION KEYWORD: Imperium - Adeptus Astartes"), and a wrong guess is visible rather than
    silent: its units come back as ones we do not have. The **looser substring reading stays on the
    whole string**, deliberately: run per part it would answer a list titled "Blood, Sweat and
    Tears" with Blood Angels, and it gains nothing — a part containing a faction name is contained
    in the whole string too. The chapter names go through `norm`, which takes the final s off every
    word; spelled out by hand they matched Raven Guard and nothing else.
  - **An export can print an attached unit TWICE** — inside its `Attached Unit N` block, so the
    reader sees who joined whom, and again under its own section, so the army list reads complete.
    A Tyranids list shows its two Tyrant Guard in both places and then states a total that counts
    them once (2000, where the printed entries add up to 2320). `foldRepeatedAttachments` folds the
    loose copy away — but only when the excess over the list's OWN stated total is exactly the
    entries that appear in both places. Decided by arithmetic, never by shape: a Deathwatch list
    really does field one Indomitor Kill Team attached and another on its own, its entries add up to
    its stated total, and a shape-based rule would have made it 275 points lighter. The number
    folded away is reported on the import screen, since the unit count is otherwise short of what
    the pasted text shows.
  - **…or in TWO blocks, because it plays a different part in each.** Masters of the Maelstrom is
    the bodyguard Huron Blackheart joins and the Support unit attached to a Chosen squad, so a
    1,990-point list prints it under both headings and charges 145 for it once — read as two units
    it came out 2,135 points with a duplicate-unit error on a datasheet limited to one. Here
    neither copy may simply go: each block states an attachment. The repeat is folded ONTO the copy
    that stays (`also`, a second `{group, attachedAs}` the entry joins in `matchRoster`), which
    imports the chain the two blocks state together — Huron leads the Masters, the Masters support
    the Chosen. Same arithmetic gate as above, plus the roles: one bodyguard and one attaching role
    is all a single unit can play, so two blocks naming it in the SAME part are two units however
    alike, and blocks that label nothing say nothing either way.
  - **A Support attachment is exported as `Support`, not as `Leader (Character)`.** Both fill a
    slot on the same bodyguard, but they are the host's two INDEPENDENT slots and the app names
    them apart; `gwText` asks `leadTypeFor` which one this is rather than assuming a leader.
  - **A missing "Attached as:" line is not a missing attachment.** An `Attached Unit N` block
    exists to say who joined whom, so anything else inside a block that HAS a bodyguard is attached
    to it. One export labels the Tyrant Guard and prints nothing at all under the Hive Tyrant above
    it, and reading only the label left the character standing alone.
  - **A paired swap is counted per PROFILE.** A stepper group counts models; within one profile a
    line naming the other half of a bundle restates the same models ("1x Storm Shield" then "1x
    Thunder hammer" is one swapped model), while across profiles the swaps are different models and
    add up. A Deathwatch Terminator Squad prints its sergeant's pair apart from the squad's, and
    folding all four lines into one bucket charged three swapped models instead of two — five points
    a squad, and the list came in over its limit.
  - **A bundled option is chosen by how much of it the list names.** The Captain in Gravis Armour
    offers three bundles differing only in the last weapon ("1 boltstorm gauntlet, 1 power fist and
    1 relic blade / chainsword / fist"); reading them one weapon at a time spent two of them. Each
    candidate is scored by the items of its bundle the list does name, minus the ones it doesn't.
  - **…and the copies it cannot hold spill into the next group.** Two groups on a Forgefiend both
    grant an ectoplasma cannon, and a list holding three of them has taken both swaps: the jaws
    bundle (which names two of the listed weapons, so it wins the first cannon) grants one, the
    pair replacing the Hades autocannons grants two. Absorbing the leftovers into the option
    already picked lost the second swap. Spilling is safe because `untouched(gi)` has already
    dropped every group whose replaced weapons the list still shows in full.
  - **Two brackets can hold the same models and differ only in the SPLIT.** An Indomitor Kill Team
    is either ten Heavy Intercessors or three-to-sixteen models mixed from all three profiles, both
    at 275 points. `sizeIndexFor` takes the per-profile counts into account, because under the first
    bracket the other two profiles have no models and every wargear group of theirs capped at zero.
  - **A title can print its points several lines below its name.** The header runs until the army
    is named (a bare line that answers as a faction), the detachment line, or the first section /
    Attached Units marker; a priced line inside it is the LIST's points, not a unit's. A list whose
    name is a whole poem ends "(A poem written by Luis Untermeyer c. 1922) (2000 points)", and
    reading that as a 2000-point unit also cost the list its faction — the faction line below it was
    swallowed as that unit's body.
  - **Two picks can share a group.** A weapon offered by two of a datasheet's groups goes to a
    group nothing has been taken from yet, before a second option of one already used: a Falcon's
    shuriken cannon can replace either the scatter laser or the twin shuriken catapult, and its
    bright lance can only be the scatter laser's — taking the cannon from that group too put two
    picks in a group that allows one.
  - **A profile no list can buy still appears in the text.** Sir Hekhtur is the pilot who climbs
    out when Canis Rex is destroyed — his own datasheet, with no points and no composition in
    appdata, so the roster layer drops him (the generator's single drop) and records the name in
    the faction's `noBuild`. Every exporter prints "1x Sir Hekhtur" and his two weapons inside the
    Canis Rex entry, because that is how the datasheet reads. `matchRoster` passes those lines over:
    they are neither models of the unit (the entry is one Knight, and the count is the sum of the
    printed profile lines in both parsers) nor wargear it could take, so reporting them would put a
    problem in front of a reader who can do nothing about it — and the entry costs Canis Rex's own
    415 either way.
  - **The detachment line cannot be split as text.** The app writes every selected detachment on
    one line joined with commas and a final "and" — and detachment names contain "and" themselves:
    "Legends of Saga and Song and Saga of the Great Wolf" is TWO of them, and splitting on " and "
    gave three, of which one matched. `parseGw` therefore carries the raw line through as
    `detachmentLine`, and `resolveDetachmentLine` (in `matchRoster`, where the faction's own
    detachments are known) carves the longest known names out of it; whatever text is left, minus
    the separators, is reported as a detachment we don't have.
  - **A body can arrive with its indentation stripped** (pasted out of a rendered page rather than
    off the clipboard): every line at column 0, bullets and all, and nothing in the TEXT separating
    a model line from a weapon. `gwBody` then offers every line as a candidate model line — sharing
    objects with `weapons`, so `matchRoster` moves one across rather than counting it twice — and
    the datasheet decides which is which. A 20-model Berzerker squad had been importing as a
    5-model one, with its own profiles reported as unplaceable wargear.
  - **An option can grant two of a weapon.** "This model's lasher tendrils can be replaced with 2
    magma cutters" is one swap (`o: [[[item, 2]]]`, labelled "2× Magma cutters"), and the export
    prints what the model ends up holding — "2x Magma cutters". Counted line for line that was two
    picks in a group that allows one, and a stock Maulerfiend came out illegal. The pick count is
    divided by what one pick of that option grants (`per(ref)`), for steppers and checkbox repeats
    alike.
  - **A bundle's shared half counts for nothing.** A Deathwatch Kill Team offers a frag cannon, an
    infernus heavy bolter and a Deathwatch shotgun, each "and 1 close combat weapon" — so "4x Close
    combat weapon" over two frag cannons and two infernus bolters is four models split between two
    groups. Attributed whole to the first (a stepper group takes the LARGER of a bundle's halves,
    since both name the same models), it read as four frag cannons in a group that allows two.
    `stepperCount` now counts a bundle by the item that IDENTIFIES it — `pick.shared` records the
    names whose candidate pool spanned more than one group — and falls back to the shared ones only
    when there is nothing else to go on.
  - **A swap TAKES SOMETHING AWAY.** Two groups can offer the same weapon (a Forgefiend's ectoplasma
    cannon comes either from its autocannons or from its jaws), and the only thing telling them
    apart is what is MISSING from the list: with "2x Hades autocannon" still there, that group was
    not taken. `untouched(gi)` compares each group's `rep` items against the printed counts, and a
    group that still has all of them is used only if nothing else fits — otherwise the swap was
    charged twice.

  Two more:
  - **The first line is the list's NAME, priced or not.** Some exports come out with a bare title
    ("Bootcamp 11th die Zweite"), and that line then stood where the faction was expected — the
    import failed with "unknown faction". A first line that IS one of our faction names is still
    read as the faction (`isFactionName`, strict, unlike `matchFaction`'s fallback pass), so a list
    pasted from its faction line down keeps working. Detection had the same assumption: the
    last-resort test now looks for ANY priced line, not the first one.
  - **One weapon name can be offered by SEVERAL groups.** A Defiler swaps its baleflamer AND its
    missile launcher for a heavy reaper autocannon: two paid picks, written as two identical lines.
    A repeat now looks for a group that hasn't been used before falling back to the one already
    picked — 15 points a unit, silently.

  Two matcher rules came out of reading a real listhammer list, and both apply to the GW app too:
  - **A model line is only a model if the datasheet has a profile by that name.** `• 1x Ammo Runt`
    is printed exactly like `• 9x Flash Git`, so counting it made a ten-model unit eleven, which
    fell into the 5-model bracket and priced Flash Gitz at half. `gwBody` keeps the lines,
    `matchRoster` checks them against `def.minis` and passes the strays on as gear — where an
    attached extra may still match a wargear option.

    **But only a FLAT body decides that by name alone.** There every line was offered as a candidate
    and a known profile is the only evidence there is (the arithmetic fallback may still promote the
    rest). A body with STRUCTURE — the app's nesting, WTC's bullets — already said which lines are
    models and the parser counted them, so the only ones that leave the count are those the
    datasheet knows as WARGEAR. A model line under a name we simply do not have is still a model
    line: a WTC export collapses Gaunt's Ghosts' five named Ghosts into `5x Tanith Ghost`, and
    dropping it left the unit with one model of six.
  - **A bundled option is matched by either half.** "Their warscythe replaced with 1 hyperphase
    sword and 1 dispersion shield" is ONE option; no export names the option, they name what the
    models carry, so it arrives as two lines. `optionIndex` indexes every item inside an option,
    not just single-item ones, and a stepper takes the LARGER count from the two halves rather than
    their sum (ten swaps, not twenty). Before this a Lychguard unit imported still holding its
    printed warscythes — at the same price, so nothing in the report said so.
  - **A single-profile datasheet has no `minis`** and answers under its own name ("• 2x Chaos
    Spawn"), which was otherwise reported as wargear nobody could place. 158 datasheets game-wide
    are named for their models, and on several the count decides the price (Rangers: 5 models
    60pts, 6-10 models 110pts).
  - **Every name comparison folds the plural, in any word** (`norm`, `.replace(/s\b/g, '')`). The
    two sides disagree in BOTH directions and it is never the same side twice: listhammer prints
    "5x Tyranid Warriors" for a profile our data calls `Tyranid Warrior`, "10x Genestealers" for a
    profile called `Genestealer` whose weapon appdata holds as `Genestealers claws and talons`, and
    "5x Ranger" for the datasheet `Rangers`. Safe because nothing in the game is told apart by that
    letter: across all 30 factions no two datasheets, detachments, enhancements, profiles or wargear
    items fold together — the only names that do are one weapon written both ways (Bolt pistol /
    Bolt pistols). Getting this wrong costs points, not just tidiness: the Warriors' own model line
    read as wargear dropped a six-model unit into the three-model bracket, at half price.
  - **A bundle may arrive as ONE name.** `2 with Sergeant's autogun and close combat weapon` is a
    single option of two items, and `optionLabel` joins those with ` + ` — so the line answered to
    neither the label nor an item and the pick was lost silently (the option is free, so the points
    said nothing). A name is split on ` and ` only when the whole of it is unknown and every part is
    known: `Genestealer claws and talons` is one weapon and resolves as one.
  - **A unicode hyphen is a hyphen.** Appdata types 25 weapon names with a non-breaking (U+2011) or
    unicode (U+2010) hyphen — `Psyko‑gatler`, `Kombi‑rokkit`, every Space Wolves `master‑crafted`
    weapon, the Votann `Autoch‑pattern bolter` — where the rest of the game uses the plain one. No
    export writes them that way, so each of those weapons came back as wargear that could not be
    placed. `norm` folds every dash variant to `-`.
  - **An ampersand is "and".** listhammer writes `Genestealer Claws & Talons` where the datasheet
    reads "claws and talons" — every Tyranid melee weapon in a list is spelled that way, and each
    one was reported as wargear that could not be placed. No name in our data contains an
    ampersand, so the two forms can only ever be the same name.
  - **An enhancement's kind tag is ignored on both sides.** Our generated data keeps it inside the
    name for some factions (`Dead Shiny Shootas (Upgrade)`), the app leaves it off, listhammer
    prints it — three spellings of one enhancement, compared through `enhKey`.

  **Leader AND Support both attach.** A bodyguard unit holds one of each (two independent slots, see
  `leaderTargetsFor`), and the app names them that way; matching only `Leader` left the second
  character of a block unattached.

  **A block may say nothing but its header.** The app writes `Attached as: Bodyguard` / `Leader
  (Character)` under each member, and the linking used to need that label; listhammer prints
  `Attached Unit 3` and then the two datasheets, and every attachment in such a list was lost. So an
  unlabelled block is resolved from the DATASHEETS instead — `leadTypeFor` says which member the
  others may join, and the link is made only when exactly one member fits and only for members that
  may actually join it. Two units left standing alone is a smaller lie than an attachment the rules
  forbid, and it is what the reader can see and fix.

  Both listhammer modes are pinned end to end against the real generated Orks bundle: every unit of
  the detailed export prices exactly as the site stated it, and the short export — given the faction
  and detachments the screen asks for — comes out as the same army.

  **What each format cannot carry**, pinned by the round-trip tests: neither WTC shape has a field
  for the list's own NAME, so an imported one comes back as "Roster" — everything else, attachment
  included, survives. The GW format survives a round trip whole.
  - **A WTC header is not always where the format says it is** (added 2026-08-25). Real lists put
    the player's own notes above the opening row of `+` ("VALIDE", their name, a link to a video of
    the army), print only the CLOSING row, or print no row at all. `wtcHeader` required the block on
    the first non-blank line and answered "no header" otherwise — which cost the faction, the
    points, the detachment, the warlord and every enhancement on **15 of the 45** WTC lists in a
    604-list corpus, not one of which resolved to a faction. It now finds the block by its FIELDS
    (`+ KEY: value`, continued by `& …`) and reads a row of `+` as its end, never as its beginning.
  - **A player can NAME a model, and the app prints that name after the points**: "Palatine (60
    points) - Palatine Eristine". `POINTS_LINE` ended at the closing parenthesis, so those were not
    unit lines at all — four characters in one Sororitas list went missing, 280 points of it, and
    the one printed under a squad was read as that squad's wargear. The suffix is tolerated and
    dropped: the name is the player's, not a datasheet's.
  - **…or TAG one in the same field**: "Commander in Enforcer Battlesuit (Blue)" beside "(Black)".
    No datasheet in the game is named with a trailing parenthesis (checked across all 30 factions),
    so `matchRoster` retries the lookup without one.
  - **A list can arrive through a broken encoding** — UTF-8 read back as cp1252, so "T’au Empire" is
    "Tâ€™au Empire" and every bullet is "â€¢". Never slightly wrong: the faction is unrecognisable
    AND no line is a bullet any more, so the nesting `gwBody` reads is gone with it. `repairMojibake`
    puts the text back through the bytes once, before `detectFormat` and `parseList` see it, and
    bails out whole on anything that is not that damage (an emoji in the title has no byte to go
    back to).
  - **The faction can also be stated as a chain, without an apostrophe, or as a keyword**: "Imperium
    - Adeptus Astartes - Ultramarines" (the alliance is stripped at the FIRST hyphen, which leaves
    the Chapter behind another one), "Tau Empire", "Legiones Daemonica". `matchFaction` splits its
    candidates on `,` and ` - `, compares apostrophe-blind after the exact pass, and holds a
    keyword→faction map for the keywords that belong to exactly one faction — HERETIC ASTARTES is
    four of them and is deliberately not in it.
  - **…and some lists state it only in their TITLE**: "Big Mek Marian - Orks", or a header line
    reading "Thousand Sons - Priority Assets - Grand Coven (2000 Points)". Read last, after every
    bare line has failed, and strictly by our own names part by part: the looser reading turned a
    Custodes list its author called "Orks Orks Orks" into an Orks one, where asking the reader which
    faction it is was the honest answer and the one they got before.
  - **A weapon a bundle grants ONE of does not account for a line naming three.** Joining an option
    already picked used to end the line's placement, so a Forgefiend printing "3x Ectoplasma cannon"
    made one swap instead of two and cost 165 where the list said 175. The join now consumes only
    what that option grants and the rest spills into a group that can still grant it. `at.names.add`
    must stay BEFORE the stepper's `break`, or the same name lands in the same stepper twice and a
    Baneblade's two sponsons come out as one group of two — which validation then calls illegal.

**Checking the importer against real lists** (2026-08-25). `scripts/fetch-listhammer.py` pulls army
lists off listhammer.info: `--corpus out.json` walks the 28 40k faction pages and takes the ~25
recent tournament lists each of them publishes, full text and all; a URL argument prints one list as
the app's own export writes it. (The site is Nuxt with SSR, so every list is already in the page's
`__NUXT_DATA__` payload and nothing needs executing — it 403s a plain fetcher but not curl.) Then
`npm run roster:imports -- corpus.json` runs the lot through `detectFormat → parseList →
matchFaction → matchRoster → validateRoster` and reports what each list lost. **Read its summary
before its lines:** most lists in any real corpus were exported against an OLDER points file and are
supposed to disagree with ours, so the checker buckets them by the `Data Version` in the export
footer against `APP_DATA_VERSION` — only the current-version bucket means anything. In the 604-list
corpus of 2026-08-25 that split was 217 current lists, 3 of which disagreed on points (all three
fixed above) against 214 that matched to the point. Neither the corpus nor the scripts are app data:
they live outside `src/`, nothing imports them, and the whole batch of fixes above added 891 bytes
to one existing chunk.

`--all out.json [--rtt]` (2026-09-19) walks the API behind those pages instead —
`/api/recentLists?page=N&gameType=40k`, 25 a page, ~1,800 GT lists (~4,700 with RTTs) — and is the
corpus to use: the faction pages hand out 25 a faction and are thin on the current version. The
1,817-list pass of 2026-09-19 (157 at v946) found, and the importer now handles: **nesting read
from the bullets** — listhammer strips the indentation, so every app export arrived flat with all
profiles' weapons pooled ("•" is the model line, "◦" its weapons; a bare line among them is a
comment, not a model); **bundle fit scored per profile and by what the list holds MORE of than
printed** (a Seraphim Superior's plasma pistol + power weapon against the squad's bolt pistols; a
Death Company Marine's inferno pistol + chainsword against + power fist); **each profile's own
printed stock absorbs its lines before any line borrows unit-wide**; **a half shared by every
option of one group is not a pick count** (Purgation Squad's close combat weapons); **a stepper
takes its group's room and spills the rest** to the next candidate, and a line joining a bundle
already picked takes that bundle's pick count (three power fists = two inferno bundles + the plain
swap; a Stormsword's five twin heavy bolters = the lascannon bundle once + the flamer swap once);
**an uncapped group is bounded by its models** (`wargearGroupFallbackCap`); **the same option offered
by two groups is not a shared half** (the Raptors' two identical special-weapon groups: "1x Meltagun"
inherited the count of the "2x Close combat weapon" line and became two), **room is read per option
where the group is one-of-a-kind** (`dup` — two plasma guns on 10 Raptors are one from each group),
**a group with a cap of 0 is not opened** (the 10-model group at 5 models), and **a weapon two groups
offer leaves the group that is the only home of a later line** (a Carnifex's crushing claws go to
the scything talons so the heavy venom cannon keeps the extra pair) — all 2026-09-19, the corpus lost
13 false alarms and gained none; **the WTC parser keeps a
WTC body under section headings or an "Attached unit" line** — only the app's own tells ("Attached
as:", "◦") route to the app's parser — and tolerates "(With Outriders)" after the points; **points
glued to the name** ("Vertus Praetors215 Points", a paste from the rendered page). Validation:
**an Upgrade counts once toward the enhancement limit** however many units carry it (muster rules;
eight legal lists were flagged). Across the corpus: over-limit wargear 219 → 24 lines, unknown
datasheets 232 → 163 (the rest are old-codex units, foreign-language exports and hand-typed lists),
current-version lists clean 132 → 148 of 157. What is left at v946 is the lists' own doing (no
Warlord set, comments pasted into a unit) and one open question: two GT lists price the Vindicare
at 130 and the Eversor at 115 where MFM v1.4 says 110/100 — a points update the website does not
show yet, or not; not ours to guess.

- `rosterShare.js` — roster → deflate-compressed base64url payload carried in the URL
  **hash** (`/roster/shared#r=<payload>`, never reaches the server/CDN). Version-prefixed
  decoder (`1.` = deflate-raw, `0.` = uncompressed fallback for engines without
  `CompressionStream`, i.e. Safari < 16.4). The payload also carries `v`, the STORAGE
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` — a link is as long-lived as a bookmark and holds the same indices-into-
  generated-data a stored roster does, so `importRoster` runs it through the same `migrateRoster`
  rather than trusting it. A payload with no `v` predates the field and is migrated from zero.
- `rosterHandoff.js` — pre-fills the Game Tracker's **setup draft** (`GameSetup` hydrates it
  on mount) rather than the saved-game format itself. **Nothing calls it since 2026-08-28**: its
  one caller was the editor header's "use in tracker" button, removed on request — a list is
  attached to a game from the tracker's own side (`RosterPickerModal` in setup, `EditSetupModal`
  mid-game), which is where somebody starting a game already is. The module and its tests stay;
  deleting them is a separate decision. Removing that button also took `useTracker` out of the
  editor, which was the one place the builder statically pulled the mission/event datasets. A partial draft is fine: `GameSetup` merges
  its own defaults over whatever fields this sets. It also ATTACHES the roster (below) — arriving
  from "play this list" is the one moment the fielded list is known for certain.
- `rosterGameLink.js` — the roster↔game link, pure and store-free. See the section below.
- **`leadsFor(def, entry, detachments)`** (`rosterEngine.js`) — the units an ENTRY can attach to:
  its datasheet's own `leads` (minus any the roster's detachments gate out, see below) plus any its
  enhancement grants (`enhAttachOf`). 13 enhancements
  game-wide widen the attach list — Necrons' Murdermind gives a Cryptek the Destroyer squads,
  Astra Militarum's Abhuman Detail lets a Commissar join Ogryns — from appdata's
  `enhancement_bodyguard_group`, emitted by the generator as `attach` in the same `{ to, type }`
  shape `leads` uses. **Never read `def.leads` directly when an entry is in hand**: the picker
  (`leaderTargetsFor`), the reverse "attached leaders" list in both views, and `validateRoster`'s
  `leaderTargetInvalid` / `manyLeaders` checks all go through `leadsFor`, or a legal granted
  attach gets reported as an illegal one. The list holds one entry per target, printed first and
  a granted duplicate dropped, because callers read it both with `.find()` (first wins) and via
  `new Map()` (last wins) — two entries for one target would resolve to different types.
  Dropping the enhancement afterwards leaves the now-illegal attachment in place and lets
  `validateRoster` warn about it, rather than silently rewriting the roster.
  A lead can also carry **`reqDet`/`exclDet`** — a detachment uuid, matched against the `sid` on the
  roster's detachment objects. 59 leads carry each today, all Chaos Space Marines, where appdata
  states the same Pactbound Zealots attachments twice (once required-inside, once excluded-outside):
  the two halves cover every case, which is why ignoring both fields happened to give the right
  answer. It only happened to — one appdata bump away from a one-sided gate. `gatedLeads()` applies
  them and dedupes by target+type afterwards, since a collapsed pair must leave exactly one entry
  (callers read the list both with `.find()` and through `new Map()`).
- **`addUnitEntry` / `removeUnitEntry`** (`rosterEngine.js`) — the two operations every screen that
  edits a roster's `units` performs, kept in one place because the removal has a second half that is
  easy to forget: a Leader attached to the departing unit has to let go of it. The creation wizard's
  own copy did forget it. `useRosterEditing` and `RosterCreateView` both call these; a screen that
  writes to `roster.units` any other way is a bug waiting to be reported as "my leader is attached
  to nothing".
- **`capKeyOf(def)`** (`rosterEngine.js`) — the identity a unit's duplicate cap
  (`duplicateLimit`) is grouped by. Defaults to the datasheet's own `id`; an optional `charId`
  field is the extension point for the real (currently unrepresented in any faction's
  `src/data/roster/<slug>.js`) 40k case of one named Epic Hero published as two distinct
  datasheets — GW caps them as ONE slot even though the `id`s differ. `duplicateCounts()`
  (`rosterValidation.js`) is the shared tally built on top of it. **"Check legality"**
  (`roster.checkLegality`, per-roster, default `true`) is the player-facing toggle: on, it
  live-enforces `duplicateLimit` by disabling `RosterUnitBrowser`'s "+" button once a unit's
  cap group is full; off, unlimited adding (today's pre-toggle behaviour). This is layered on
  top of, not a replacement for, `validateRoster()`'s own always-on `overDuplicate` issue — the
  two share the same `capKeyOf` grouping so they never disagree. Toggled on the creation
  wizard's step 1 (`RosterCreateView.vue`, last field) and the editor's Settings tab
  (`RosterEditorView.vue`) — both write straight to the roster object. A count strictly OVER
  its cap (not just at it — unreachable through the "+" button itself, but reachable by lowering
  the battle size on step 1 *after* units were added under a bigger one) turns
  `RosterUnitBrowser`'s `N/limit` badge red (`.rub-count.over`). `RosterCreateView.vue` now also
  runs `validateRoster()` live (previously editor-only) and shows the same `issues-badge` +
  `RosterIssuesModal` the editor's header has, next to the points readout in step 2's
  `.rc-sticky` — so `overDuplicate` (and everything else `validateRoster` catches) is
  visible during the wizard, not just after `finish()` lands on the read-only view.

## The desk — three columns above 1200px (added 2026-09-01)

On a wide screen both building screens drop the tabs/steps and lay everything out at once: a
**settings bar** across the top and **three columns** under it — catalogue, the list, and the
chosen unit's fields. Below 1200px nothing changes; the editor keeps its tabs, the wizard its two
steps, and the phone its modal.

- **`RosterWorkbench.vue`** owns both arrangements, so the catalogue and the list are written once
  per screen: `desk` renders the three columns, otherwise it renders the same `.roster-panes`
  markup the two screens always had. Each column — the desk's three (2026-09-18) and the two panes
  below it (2026-09-19) — **scrolls inside itself, and the page does not scroll at all.** The
  model is a flex column, not a measured column: while the columns are showing, the screen's root
  carries `.rw-host` (`style.css`) — a flex column exactly `100dvh − --rw-top − --rw-below` tall —
  and every box between the root and the columns is `.rw-fill`, passing the room down; header,
  tabs and the faction-rules fold keep their natural height, the columns (`flex: 1; min-height:
  0`, one `minmax(0, 1fr)` grid row) take the rest. The two numbers CSS cannot know are measured
  by the workbench and written on the root: `--rw-top`, where the root starts in the document
  (navbar, an update banner, the page's top padding), and `--rw-below`, the paddings between the
  root and the end of `.main-content` — summed from computed styles, never read off the boxes,
  because `.main-content` can be as tall as the window on a short page and measuring against its
  edge fed the root's height back into itself. Neither changes while the user works inside the
  screen, so the observers (body, `.main-content`'s border box — the reserve is its padding — and
  `resize`) fire on real changes only; the fold opening above the columns shrinks them in the
  same layout pass with no script in the loop. The first version measured where the COLUMNS
  start and re-measured on every frame of the fold's animation; the columns lagged the fold by a
  frame, the page became scrollable and unscrollable in alternation, and a phone showed it as the
  whole screen shivering. `App.vue`'s `.main-content--desk` padding is the only reserve under the
  screen at every width — the fixed Cancel/Save bar, the bottom nav where there is one, a gap —
  and the two screens' own footer paddings went with this. Before 2026-09-18 the columns were
  sticky under the navbar and capped against it alone, and the page still scrolled by the height
  of everything above them; below the desk that arrangement lasted a day longer, and on a phone
  it meant a finger on the catalogue scrolled the catalogue until it ran out and then the page
  (scroll chaining), which a player described as the page «lagging». A `min-height` floor (16rem
  on the desk, 12rem in the panes — a phone with the keyboard up has less to give) keeps a column
  usable if the fold above opens on something long; the columns then overflow the root and the
  page scrolls, which beats an unusable column. All columns are `container-type: inline-size`,
  which is why nothing inside them needed rewriting: the rows already size themselves against
  their pane. Because height is what the columns are paid from, both screens fold what sits above
  them on a phone (≤900px): the editor hides its back link (the bar's Back goes to the same place)
  and shrinks the name row and tab margins; the wizard puts the back link and the step markers on
  one line. The Settings tab and the wizard's step 1 are ordinary pages: `.rw-host` is bound to
  the columns being up.
- **`RosterSettingsBar.vue`** is the top line — name, faction, detachments (with the DP count),
  battle size, Force Disposition, then the points and the issue badge. It holds no state: both
  callers own a roster and do different things with the same answer (the wizard's faction pick also
  creates the draft), so it reports and emits, pickers included. Notes and the legality switch are
  behind its "…" — decided once, then never looked at again, and a permanent slot for them would
  spend the line on the two things nobody reads twice. The editor passes `show-name="false"`: its
  page header already IS the name field.
- **`RosterUnitList` gained `placement="pane"`**, where a row neither unfolds nor opens a modal —
  it only marks itself chosen (`.rul-picked`) and reports the uid. Same `openUid` as the accordion,
  so there is one idea of "the unit being worked on" in either arrangement.
- **`RosterEntryFields.vue`** wires `UnitEditorFields` up. The enhancement options, the leader
  targets and the may-this-be-Warlord test are pure functions of the roster, and each screen
  computed them in an identical fifteen-line block at the slot — which the desk would have made
  four copies of. The callers now pass the roster.
- **The wizard's Save is its bar's only action on the desk** — there is no step to go back to, and
  nothing sequential to go forward through. `finish()` still calls `ensureDraft()`, so saving
  straight from the desk creates the roster the same way arriving at step 2 did. The wizard also
  grew **notes** here (the bar offers them and the editor always had them), written through
  `step1Patch()` like every other setting.
- **The points live in the bar on the desk**, and the sticky footer keeps only Cancel/Save — the
  same number in both places would be the same number twice. `.rc-sticky` itself stays at every
  width: `App.vue` matches it by name to reserve `--roster-sticky-h`, which the columns' own
  `max-height` then subtracts.
- **Width comes from `App.vue`** (`main-content--desk`, 1600px, inside a `min-width: 1200px` query
  — the 860px reading measure cannot hold three columns). Printing is excluded from it by path: its
  width is the paper's.

## Editing flow (reworked 2026-08-19, panes 2026-08-27, desk 2026-09-01)

The editor has **two** panels: Settings and Units. The Units panel holds the faction catalogue
and the roster's own list **side by side**, at every width (`.roster-panes` in `style.css`), and
the creation wizard's step 2 is the same pair of panes. Above 1200px both are replaced by the desk
layout above — what follows describes the arrangement below that threshold, which is unchanged.

It was three screens before, and the split is what the rework undid: browsing the catalogue was a
page of its own (`/roster/:id/add`), configuring a unit was the editor's Units tab, and in the
wizard they were steps 2 and 3. That was defensible while a unit's price was its datasheet's — it
stopped being defensible once wargear started deciding the price, because then every unit costs a
round trip: add it there, see what it costs here. The reader who reported it had built a list that
way and called the flow «путано».

The panes are two columns on a phone as well, which is a deliberate choice and not an oversight —
but half a phone is ~180px, and everything inside a pane has to be laid out for that. Since
2026-09-19 each pane is its own scroll area on a page that stands still (see the desk section
above for the mechanics — the same `RosterWorkbench` measurement); the alternative of one tab per
pane was offered and turned down by the owner in favour of keeping both in view.

**Both panes are query containers** (`container-type: inline-size`) and every compact arrangement
inside them is an `@container (max-width: 300px)` rule, not a media query. A viewport breakpoint
cannot answer the question that matters: a 390px phone and a 780px tablet hand each pane the same
~180px. The first pass used `@media (max-width: 380px)` and never fired on the phone it was written
for — 390 is not below 380 — which is how a squeezed pane shipped with full-size type in it.

What the narrow arrangement changes, in the order it matters:

- **The copy and delete buttons only get smaller.** They left the row's flow at EVERY width on
  2026-08-28 (`.rul-acts`, absolute over the tile's top-right corner) — in flow they were a column
  as tall as the tile, so a three-line entry showed two icons floating alone in a dead band and the
  wargear paid ~4rem of every line for them. Only the tile's FIRST line reserves the strip
  (`--rul-acts-w`, read by `RosterUnitRow`); here that is the name's line (`padding-right`, plus a
  `min-height` for a one-line name), on a wide screen the points'. What the narrow pane still does
  is shrink them, and drop the chevron entirely — at this width its 1.2rem is worth more to the
  wargear line than the affordance is.
- **The points move down beside the chips** (`RosterUnitRow` is a grid, and the two arrangements
  are two placements of the same four parts). A points column costs the text ~3rem of every row,
  which is what turned one Chosen squad's four picks into a twelve-line column. On a wide screen
  they stay on the name's line instead, holding the action buttons' strip beside them — and the
  chips and the wargear span BOTH grid columns, so the only line paying for the buttons is that
  first one.
- **The catalogue's rows stack their name over their price** (`RosterUnitBrowser`) — three or four
  words and a number do not share 180px — and its whole scale steps down. `.rub-name` also carries
  `min-width: 0`, without which a long name refuses to shrink past its min-content and runs *under*
  the price instead of wrapping.
- **The attached-unit rail indents by 0.4rem instead of 1.25rem** (`style.css`). The rail still
  says "these belong together" at a third of the width. The catalogue pane **sticks and scrolls inside itself** — under the app's
sticky navbar, clear of the fixed points/save bar (`--roster-sticky-h`) and of the mobile bottom
nav — while the list flows with the page beside it. Giving both panes their own fixed height
instead needs a height calculation that every one of those bars is free to invalidate.

**The catalogue no longer takes focus on mount.** Autofocusing its search box was right while it
had a screen to itself; as a pane it would pop the keyboard over the list the reader came to see.

`src/composables/useRosterEditing.js` still holds the editor's state — the roster, its faction
data and add/duplicate/remove. It was written to keep the editor and the add-units page from each
having their own idea of what adding a unit means; with the catalogue folded in it has one
consumer, and is kept because the wizard performs the same operations on a roster it does not own.
The implementations underneath (`rosterEngine`'s `addUnitEntry` / `duplicateUnitEntry` /
`removeUnitEntry`) are what actually keep the two screens agreeing.

**What it merely READS off the roster is `useRosterDerived.js`** (see Shared derivations above):
it is a thin wrapper adding the load-by-id and the mutations on top.

An issue raised from the catalogue concerns one entry, which is now in the pane beside it — the
issues modal just opens that entry's configuration. The editor still accepts `?unit=<uid>` and
opens that accordion, clearing the query; that watcher is declared **after** `openUid` on purpose,
since it runs immediately during setup and referencing a `const` declared further down hits the
temporal dead zone (it did).

**One sticky bar serves both wizard steps** (2026-08-28). Step 1's "Next" used to sit in the
page's own flow, at the end of the setup card — which on a phone put it directly under
`MobileUtilityBar`'s floating "To game" button. That bar lifts itself by `--roster-sticky-h`,
which `App.vue` sets from `:has(.rc-sticky)`, so the way out of the collision was for Next to BE
the sticky bar rather than to sit beneath it. The bar is now a sibling of both panels and its
contents are the current step's: Next on step 1, points + issues + Back/Save on step 2. Both
`.rc-panel`s pay the bar's height in `padding-bottom` (it used to be `:has(.rc-sticky)`, which
matched only the panel that contained it), and `.rc-sticky-actions` carries `margin-left: auto`,
without which step 1's lone button lands at the LEFT edge under the inner's `space-between`.

**The wizard is two steps, not three** ("Setup", then "Units"). A draft stored on the old step 3
resumes on the step that absorbed it (`Math.min(resumed.draftStep || 1, 2)`). Its step markers are
buttons: step 2 stays disabled until a faction is picked (the same gate step 1's Next button uses),
and jumping forward routes through `goToUnits()` so the roster still gets created rather than being
skipped past.

**The wizard's units are written through to the saved roster, not held until "Save"** (`syncUnits()`
in `RosterCreateView.vue`, called from add/remove and from `goToUnits`). They used to live in
component state until `finish()`, so leaving the way every other screen expects to be left — the
"Back to list" link at the top, a phone's back gesture, a reload — threw the whole list away and left
behind a roster that had been created on step 2 but was empty. `updateRoster` assigns the SAME array,
so its identity is shared with the store from then on and the per-entry edits ride the store's own
deep-watch autosave; that is why `pickFaction` empties it with `splice(0)` rather than assigning a
new one. Its add/remove go through `rosterEngine`'s `addUnitEntry`/`removeUnitEntry` — the same
implementation `useRosterEditing` uses, not a second copy.

**`RosterUnitList.vue` draws the list on both screens** — sections, attached-unit blocks, the
per-entry copy and delete buttons, and which entry is open. The configuration itself stays with the
caller, through a `fields` scoped slot: `UnitEditorFields` needs the roster's detachments, its other
entries, the enhancement options and the leader targets, all of which the views already compute.
What the component decides is only WHERE those fields go — inline under the row on a wide screen,
and in a modal below 900px, because a wargear editor does not fit in half a phone. That modal is
teleported to `<body>` and so leaves the view's faction-accent scope behind, which is what the
`FactionAccentScope` wrapper inside it is for (same trap as `RosterUnitRulesModal`).

**The collapsed row is `RosterUnitRow.vue`**, one component for both building screens — the
editor's Units tab and the wizard's config step, which held identical markup under two class
prefixes. It prints the name, then chips for what distinguishes THIS entry from another copy of the
same datasheet (model count, attachment slot, enhancement — including a mandatory one, which is
derived and never stored — and allegiance), then the wargear the player actually chose.

The **default loadout is deliberately not there** any more. It is the same on every copy of a
datasheet, it is printed on the datasheet itself, and as three or four lines of dim 0.74rem text per
unit it stood between the reader and the two facts above; the accordion's own "Default wargear"
block is one tap away. In a narrow pane the row also steps its whole type scale down rather than
only shrinking one part of it, so it keeps its hierarchy — see the Editing flow section for what
else changes at that width.

**A configured entry can be copied** (`duplicateUnitEntry`, the row's copy button next to its
delete). Adding the same datasheet twice through the catalogue gives a bare entry both times, so
the second squad — usually the first one again — had every wargear pick made a second time. Three
fields are deliberately not inherited, each unique per ARMY and each of which would make the copy
illegal the moment it appeared: `warlord`, `enh` (a MANDATORY enhancement isn't stored on the entry,
`mandatoryEnhancementFor` derives it, so it rides along by itself) and `leaderOf` (the host's slot
is filled by the entry being copied). The copy lands directly after its original, which is also what
puts the copy tax on the row that just appeared rather than on the one that was there. The button
stops at the duplicate cap with the same two helpers the catalogue's "+" uses
(`duplicateCounts`/`duplicateLimit`) — otherwise the one control that adds a unit without going
through the catalogue would be the one that ignores the cap. At the cap it is **absent, not
greyed**: a dead control earns its place by saying why it is dead, and this one no longer has to,
because the same unit is in the catalogue pane beside the list with its own "+" greyed and its
`N/limit` badge showing. That argument only holds since the panes — the two were a screen apart
before, which is when the general rule ("grey it with a reason rather than hiding it") was
written.

**Picking a size bracket fills it to the top** (`setSize` in `UnitEditorFields.vue`). The
Munitorum prints ONE price for a whole bracket, so a 6-model unit in a "6-10 · 270pts" bracket
pays the 10-model price — almost nobody means to buy that, and the editor used to leave the count
at the bracket MINIMUM and make the player press "+" four times to say otherwise. 204 of 1038
units have a ranged bracket; **none has a ranged DEFAULT bracket**, so adding a unit is untouched
by this and `addUnitEntry` needs no say in it. A fixed-size bracket still leaves `count` absent —
the stored entry says nothing it doesn't have to — and the reading of a stored `count`-less entry
is unchanged everywhere (`entry.count ?? per[0]`), so no saved roster changes meaning.

The other end is stated rather than left to be discovered: the models heading carries a `min N`
chip, the same bordered chip a wargear group's "up to 2" allowance uses. Three units do pay per
model on top of the bracket (Terminator Assault Squad, Venatari Custodians, Victrix Honour Guard —
the `dw` units with a ranged bracket), so filling up costs them a little more than the pill says;
the running total and the "Default wargear" heading both show it as it happens.

**An attached unit is drawn as one block** (`joinAttached` inside `sectionsOf`, `pairAttached:
true`). A Leader and the unit it joined are ONE unit (core rules 19.01 — the same reading
`RosterViewView`'s `attachedEntries` already writes every game state across both halves with), but
filing them by battlefield role sat them in different sections, and the more important the
character the further apart they went: an Epic Hero at the top of the list, its squad at the
bottom, joined only by an "attached to…" tag on each pointing at the other.

The block moves into a section of its own, `attached`, first in `UNIT_GROUPS` — `bucketOf` never
returns that id, the pairing pass is the only thing that fills it. **Unless any part of the block
belongs to an ally group**: an ally heading carries that group's own accounting and a unit must not
leave it, so there the block is gathered in place instead, host first. (Six ally units can lead and
four can be led, all Aeldari — Harlequins and Ynnari.)

The three list screens then draw it the same way, from one pair of primitives in `style.css`
(`.roster-attached`, `.roster-sum`): the bodyguard's tile, each character indented under it on an
accent rail, then the block's own points. Those points are printed **once, under the last row**
(`attachedBlockTotal`) rather than as a combined figure on the bodyguard — the per-row numbers
above it still read down the column and still add up to the roster total, which a combined figure
would have quietly broken. What each row keeps is a **role tag** ("Leader" / "Support"): the
nesting says which unit a character joined, but not which slot it fills. The old reciprocal
tags — "Attached to X" on the character, "X (Leader)" on the squad — are gone with the distance
that made them necessary.

`pairAttached` is off by default, which is what keeps `RosterUnitBrowser` out of it: the catalogue
lists datasheets, and nothing is attached to a datasheet.

**A group's heading is prose, and is set as prose** (`.ues-h.ues-instr`). `style.css` puts every
`h1`–`h4` in the display face — Sofia Sans **Extra Condensed** — which is right for the two-word
labels the other sections of this editor carry ("Unit size", "Default wargear") and wrong for the
sentence a wargear group leads with: *"1 Cultist Champion's autopistol can be replaced with 1 bolt
pistol"*, which in Russian is prose wrapped around English item names, and at weight 600 in a
condensed face is two lines of narrow strokes. That one heading takes the body face at a normal
weight; it keeps full colour and stays larger than the option list under it, so it still leads the
group. Only the letterforms change.

## The player's own notes (added 2026-08-28)

Free text hung on a list for **planning a game** — "rapid ingress T2" beside a unit, a paragraph
for the list. Asked for after War Organ, which carries the same fields. Two of them, read at two
different moments:

| Field | Lives on | Shown |
|---|---|---|
| `roster.notes` | the roster | a folded block above the tabs of `RosterViewView` (in a game too) |
| `entry.note` | one entry | in parentheses after the unit's name, on every list row |

**Nothing reads them.** `validateRoster` never looks at a note, no note is priced, translated,
matched against appdata or allowed to make a list illegal. They are the player's words, in the
player's language, and they show as typed in both locales.

- **An attached block has no note of its own**, and that is a decision, not a gap. War Organ names
  its groups, so this was built the same day and taken out again: a block is derived from `leaderOf`
  and has no record to hang a name on, so the name lived on the block's host and had to be shown
  either in a heading of its own — a row of a 640px phone per block — or on the block's total line,
  where the player who asked for the feature could not find it. A note on the host unit says the
  same thing in a place that is already read. Don't rebuild it without solving that first.
- **The list's notes start folded, and the fold is not remembered.** What is worth a row of the
  first screen is the army; a plan is read at a moment, not throughout.
- **No `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump and no backend change.** A note is absent rather than empty (`setNote`
  deletes on clear), so a roster that predates this simply has none, and `domain/roster.ts` is
  `.passthrough()` — the same free ride `roster.disposition` took.
- **`rosterShare`'s `PICK` carries `notes`**, so a share link and a **game snapshot** keep the plan;
  the per-entry ones ride along inside `units`. That is also why the caps exist (`ENTRY_NOTE_MAX`
  60, `ROSTER_NOTES_MAX` 2000): a synced game has 64 KB for the whole thing, both armies included.
- **`setNote` folds whitespace to single spaces** — one line, because a unit's note is printed
  inline after its name. The list's notes are the exception and are written straight
  (`RosterEditorView.setNotes`): a plan is a paragraph, and `white-space: pre-wrap` keeps its lines.
- **No placeholders in either field.** The caption beside the input already says what it is, and a
  greyed example reads as content that is already there.
- **The unit's note shares the top row of `UnitEditorFields` with the datasheet button**, which is
  now the app's ghost button rather than the bare text link it used to be (it read as a caption).
  Those two are the only things in that panel that aren't configuration: one leads out to the
  unit's rules, the other is the player's own line about it. A section of its own at the foot cost
  a heading, a rule and a row of the phone for one short field. On a build pane (~180px) the row
  stacks.

**Not done yet, on purpose:** notes are neither printed on the sheet nor written into any export,
and the importer still drops what it finds. `rosterImport`'s `defOf` already strips a trailing
parenthetical to match a datasheet ("no datasheet in the game is named with a trailing
parenthesis"), so a note in a GW-app or War Organ list survives as far as the matcher and is thrown
away one line later — capturing it into `entry.note` is most of the round-trip. A note in the WTC
export is a separate decision: tournament organisers parse that grammar.

## Faction rules beside the build (added 2026-08-28)

`RosterRulesPanel.vue`, above the two panes on **both** building screens — the wizard's Units step
and the editor's Units tab. The question a half-built list raises is "what does my detachment
actually do?", and the answer used to live on the faction pages, one navigation out of the builder
and back (the resume chip in "Views" exists because of that trip). The list's own Rules tab is no
help either: it is on the finished list's view screen.

- **Folded twice.** The panel starts closed — it is reference, not the work — and each thing inside
  it is its own fold: the army rule, one per picked detachment, the enhancements those detachments
  offer, their stratagems. Opening "what does my detachment do" must not also unroll thirty
  stratagem cards. Closed, the header still names the detachments it is about, so the panel says
  whether it is worth opening.
- **Nothing loads until it is opened.** The `loadRosterFactionRules` call hangs off the open flag
  (30-60 KB of faction bundle), and `RuleBlock`/`StratCard` are `defineAsyncComponent` — they are
  only rendered once that data is in, so they travel with it instead of with the builder's chunk.
  `CollapseTransition` renders its slot even while shut, so gating on the DATA is what actually
  keeps them out; a `v-if` on the fold would be the same thing said twice.
- **Same loader as the Rules tab and the print sheet** (`composables/rosterFactionRules.js`): a
  detachment object carries its rule, its stratagems and its enhancements together, and the lookup
  resolves a Chapter's list naming a Space Marines detachment. A name it cannot resolve gets no
  fold rather than an error.
- **The open state is not remembered**, neither the panel's nor the inner folds' — same call as the
  list's notes fold.
- Enhancements are rendered here as a plain name/points/body list, NOT `FactionRuleView`'s
  `.enh-card` grid: this sits above a pane that is ~180px wide on a phone.

## What the catalogue hides, and the shelf it reads (added 2026-08-28)

`RosterUnitBrowser` carries two checkboxes under its search box, folded away under a "Filters"
header — the same accordion its groups use, so the pane reads as one list of collapsible things
rather than as a toolbar bolted onto a list. The boxes are the app's shared `.check` rows
(`style.css`), not a private pill.

Both **hide** rather than dim, and that is not a preference: this list already spends opacity on
"not in the roster yet" (`.rub-item`), so there is no dim left to mean "you cannot afford it". The
shape is the detachment picker's (`DetachmentPickerModal`, the same week): what the filters took
away is counted on screen.

**Two things never go inside the fold**, because a closed accordion must not hide why the
catalogue is short: the "N hidden" line under it (inside the block, above its rule — that note is
the filters talking, not the list) and a count of the active filters on the header itself. The
fold always starts closed — until 2026-09-19 it opened whenever a remembered filter was on, which
on a phone spent three rows of the catalogue on switches already summed up by that count. A
`border-bottom` closes the
block off from the groups below: stacked in a column, its header would otherwise read as one more
battlefield role.

- **"Fits the points left"** compares `minPoints(u)` — the cheapest bracket plus any mandatory
  enhancement, exactly the figure the row prints — against the `remaining` prop, which both views
  pass as `limit - points`. No `remaining` (no battle size resolvable) takes the toggle off the
  screen rather than guessing. The promise is "its cheapest configuration fits"; a bigger bracket
  or paid wargear chosen afterwards can still take the list over, and saying so is the points
  readout's job.
- **"In my collection"** reads `useCollection` (below).

Two things follow from the pane being a list you are BUILDING, not a picker:

- **A unit already in the list is never filtered away**, by either toggle. Its row carries the "−"
  button, and a catalogue that drops what you just added — the budget ran out, or you are proxying
  something you do not own — reads as a bug. It is also why the copy tax (`def.step`) never enters
  the budget test: the surcharge lands on the Nth copy, and every unit the test prices is on its
  first.
- **The "N hidden" count is taken after `sectionsOf`, not before it.** A group whose ally
  Detachment isn't selected is not on offer whatever the toggles say, and counting it as hidden by
  the filter would be a lie. That is the one reason `allSections` exists beside `groups`; with both
  toggles off they are the same computed value and nothing is done twice.

Both toggles persist per device (`wh11ed-roster-filter-budget`, `wh11ed-roster-filter-owned`),
`getItem` at setup + a `watch`, the idiom `ChapterMissions.vue` uses for its own filters. Both
start off: the catalogue's first answer should be the whole catalogue.

### `useCollection.js` — which models the reader owns

Module singleton + `localStorage` (`wh11ed-collection`), the `useFavorites.js` pattern.
`{ [factionSlug]: { [unitId]: { n, name } } }`, and each part of that shape is load-bearing:

- **the slug is the unit's OWN faction.** An Inquisitor browsed inside a Space Marines list is an
  Imperial Agents datasheet (`allySourceOf`), and without the split two factions' ids would share
  one bucket.
- **`n`** is how many are owned. Nothing sets it above 1 — the mark is an on/off star — but the
  shape is here so "I have two boxes of these" is not a migration.
- **`name`** is the datasheet's name as it read when it was marked, and is the only way back if a
  later appdata bump moves the id out from under the mark. Nothing re-resolves by it yet; this
  only keeps that possible.

It is **not** a layer of `wh11ed-favorites`: a pin reorders a picker and is documented as never
carrying army-list semantics, while owning a box is a fact about a shelf. Keeping them apart is
what stops either from inheriting the other's meaning — and they are drawn apart too, the pin
staying `bi-pin-angle`, the owned mark a star.

Marks are set in three places, all sharing the singleton: the catalogue row's own star rail
(mirroring the +/− rail, since these rows are too dense for a corner overlay), the datasheet
grid's chips (`FactionDatasheetsView`, where a collection actually gets entered — one unit per
visit is no way to fill a shelf), and one datasheet's page header. On the chips the pin and the
star **stack** in the corner rather than standing side by side: two columns of buttons cost the
name a third line at that grid's 180px. Both are icon-only toggles and a tooltip is no answer on a
phone, so the key is printed once above the grid (`.ds-legend`) instead of on ninety chips.

The pin's own wording was fixed at the same time: the datasheet screens called it "Favorites"
(«Избранное») while the faction pickers, running the same `useFavorites` layer behind the same
icon, called it "Pinned" («Закреплённые»). One feature, one vocabulary — `dsFavAdd`, `dsFavRemove`,
`dsGroupFavorites` and the legend's own two labels are gone, and every surface now speaks through
`favPin` / `favUnpin` / `favPinnedGroup` (and `rosterFilterOwned` for the star). **Device-local**: rosters sync,
this does not, until there is a `/collection` endpoint to sync it to.

**The Warlord's mark moved to `bi-flag-fill`** the same day. The star now means "I own this model"
in the pane beside it, and one gold glyph cannot mean both on one screen. The Warlord keeps the
gold `#e3b341`; the owned star takes **`var(--accent)`** — the faction's own colour, since every
screen it appears on is already themed that way (`FactionAccentScope`'s recipe, folded into
`--accent` by the editor's, the wizard's and `FactionLayout`'s roots). Gold therefore means one
thing again. The single exception is the datasheet page's header, where the buttons sit ON the
faction-coloured hero and stay white like the rest of `.ds-btn`. Three components carried the icon
(`RosterUnitRow`, `UnitEditorFields`, `RosterUnitRulesModal`) and a fourth carried a bare `'★'` in
text — `rosterEngine`'s `entrySummary`, the read-only view's summary line, where a lone symbol on
its own row said nothing to anyone. That one now takes the Warlord noun as a fifth argument, the
same way it already takes the model and upgrade nouns, and prints the word.

### One breakdown of an army, everywhere (added 2026-08-28)

`UNIT_GROUPS` / `bucketOf` now carve a faction the way the datasheet page does
(`FactionDatasheetsView`'s `TYPE_GROUPS`), in its order: Epic Heroes → Characters → Battleline →
Dedicated Transports → Fortifications → **Vehicles** → **Infantry** → Other, with `attached` in
front, which is the one group that page has no use for. The three new buckets were already a
faction page's answer; the roster screens were still filing everything below a transport as
"Прочее", which for Necrons is 27 datasheets and says nothing about an army.

Two things that follow, and one of them nearly shipped broken:

- **`rosterExport` maps buckets to GW's four headings**, and its `OTHER DATASHEETS` listed
  `['battleline', 'other']` by name. New buckets do not join a list like that on their own — they
  would have fallen out of every section and off the exported page. Anything that switches on a
  bucket id has to be checked when this set grows; that file is the one place that does.
- **The headings are the datasheet page's labels too.** `GROUP_LABEL_KEYS` points at
  `dsGroup*`, and the five `rosterGroup*` copies (identical strings, except "Прочее" against
  "Прочие юниты") are gone. `rosterGroupAttached` stays — it is the group with no counterpart.

## Russian for the wargear instructions

The group instruction shown above each wargear choice ("The Sister Superior's boltgun can be
replaced with one of the following:") comes from appdata via `items.js`'s `texts` and is English.
`src/data/roster/ru/texts.js` is its Russian, **generated** by `scripts/gen-roster-texts-ru.mjs`
(`npm run roster:texts-ru`, `--check` in `npm run sync`), loaded lazily by `UnitEditorFields` and
only in the RU locale.

Generated rather than hand-translated for the same reason the modifier layer pins hashes: 967
strings regenerated on every appdata bump would go stale as fast as GW ships datasheets. They are
also formulaic — a dozen sentence frames wrapped around weapon and unit names, and those names
stay English by project convention, so only the frame needs translating.

**The generator is fail-open and must stay that way.** A sentence is translated only when a frame
matches end to end AND its captured slots pass two guards: the owner/subject must be a bare noun
phrase (a lazy capture otherwise swallows a leading condition and emits confident nonsense), and
the value must not contain a second frame ("…replaced with 1 shuriken pistol and one of the
following:"). Anything else is left out of the file and the UI shows the English original —
a fully English line reads fine, half-translated Russian does not. Coverage sits around 90%; the
run prints it, and a drop after a bump means GW introduced a new wording, not noise.

**The "and" between two weapons needs the item dictionary.** "tachyon arrow and Overlord's blade"
is two weapons glued with a connective; "transonic razor and chordclaw" is ONE weapon's printed
name, and the sentences are identical in shape. `slotRu()` translates the glue only when the whole
slot is not itself a known item AND every part is (`items.js` primed via `primeItemNames`) — it
tries each split point, because a half can contain the word too ("autopistol and cult claws and
knife"). Without the dictionary this is unguessable; don't replace it with a regex.

**A last guard runs on the OUTPUT, not the input.** A slot none of the guards anticipated can still
smuggle frame English into a translated sentence ("…Piranha burst cannon can be на…"). Item names
never contain `can/cannot/following/replaced/equipped`, so their presence in the result means the
capture went wrong and the line falls back to English. This is what retired the old
half-translated "…может получить up to two of the following, and can take duplicates:." lines.

Two input quirks are normalised before matching, both found in appdata itself: a stray `■` list
marker at the head of an instruction, and a no-break space where a frame expects a plain one
(`U+00A0` in "…replaced with 1 twin lascannon" cost that whole sentence its translation).

`src/data/roster/ru/texts.test.js` pins the invariants rather than any wording: no English
sentence frame survives on a translated line, no id exists that the English side doesn't have, no
doubled space or dangling noun from a slot that resolved to nothing. Both guards above were added
because that test caught real output.

The instruction is often a sentence followed by a bullet list of the options ("…one of the
following:\n◦ 1 hexrifle and 1 torturer's tool"). appdata carries those as real newlines with a
`◦`/`•` marker, which collapse into one run-on line when interpolated into a template — so
`splitInstruction()` (`rosterEngine.js`, pure) splits head from bullets and the editor renders the
bullets as a list. The RU generator emits the same line structure (its own test pins the marker
count against the English), so both locales render identically.

The other Russian on this screen is the **wargear info modal** (`WeaponProfileModal`, the ⓘ next
to a pick). Weapon names and stat lines stay English, and so does the modal's title — it is the
item's own name out of `items.js`. But a handful of items grant an ABILITY instead of a weapon
profile (Kabalite Icon, Resurrection Orb), and that prose IS translated: the modal matches on the
English sheet (item names and the overlay's own keys are English) and takes only the text from
`loadDatasheetsRu`/`localizeSheet`, pairing the two lists by position. The ability's *name* is left
English on purpose, so it stays the same string as the title right above it. Datasheet RU coverage
is complete — every faction's abilities/wargear/special/rules texts are translated — so a missing
translation here means a component that never loaded the overlay, not a gap in the data.

## Bundled wargear options

**One option can grant SEVERAL items** — "1 model's twin torturer's tools can be replaced with
1 hexrifle **and** 1 torturer's tool" is one choice, not two. appdata has no field for it: a
`wargear_option` row carries exactly one item and the pairing lives only in the group's
instruction prose, so a flat read (what this generated until 2026-08-19) offers the two items as
rival picks and silently drops half of every swap — from the loadout, the export, and Tier A's
weapon-table trim.

`gen-roster-data.mjs`'s **`linkWargearBundles`** parses the pairing out of the prose and then
**verifies it against structure**: `loadout_choice` enumerates each miniature's complete legal
loadouts (1145 of 1146 datasheets have them), so every set the prose yields must fit inside one
of them. Prose alone would be a guess. 182 groups are rewritten this way; the run prints the ones
left flat, by name, so a "missing swap" report can be checked against that list.

**The instruction may misspell an item its own wargear row spells right** (added 2026-08-24) — the
Venatari lance is replaced with "1 kinetic destroyer and 1 **tarsus** buckler" and the item is the
**Tarsis** buckler; the Rogal Dorn's turret with "1 **co-axial** autocannon" for the **Coaxial**
autocannon. Matched exactly, such a sentence names only ONE item, so the pair is emitted as two
independent options — a model can take half of a swap it has to take whole, and where the swap
refunds points each half claims the refund (six Venatari Custodians came out at 320 against the
army apps' 325). So an option the sentence hasn't named gets a second chance at one word of its
name, five letters or more, everything else identical (`nearName`), and a plural is not that word
("1 powerblades" must not claim the Powerblade array's bullet). The pair it produces still has to
sit inside an enumerated legal loadout, which is what makes the tolerance safe.

**The instruction may also spell an item with a different HYPHEN than the item table does** (added
2026-08-24) — appdata's prose is typed by hand and its item rows are not, so "1 hot‐shot laspistol
and 1 medi‐pack" carries U+2010 where both items are stored with a plain `-`, and "1 Autoch‑pattern
bolter and 1 plasma sword" carries U+2011. A literal match resolves nothing in such a statement, and
a group with even one unreadable statement is left entirely alone — the Militarum Tempestus Command
Squad's medi-pack bullet shipped as three loose options under a cap of one pick, so the medi-pack
Scion every army app prints failed validation on import. `flatText` folds the hyphen and apostrophe
variants on both sides before matching (character-level and length-preserving, so the offsets that
order a set still mean something; `norm` is not usable here because it also strips a trailing
`(…)`, which belongs to names and not to sentences). Five groups gained a pairing this way and two
gained a count, and folding the Deathwatch Veterans' pair also let the "for every 5 models, 1 model"
cap appdata records for it match its group at last — two identical options are exactly what makes a
limited-choice set ambiguous.

Two guards keep it fail-open, and both currently reject real groups — don't remove them to raise
the number: every option appdata lists must be named by the prose (else the prose is describing
something else), and a multi-item set must be backed by the enumeration. A rejected group is
emitted exactly as appdata lists it, never as a guessed pair.

**The points come with the quantity.** appdata prices an option row per ITEM — a Forgefiend's
ectoplasma cannon is 5 whether it is the one that replaces its jaws or one of the two that replace
its Hades autocannons — so an option the prose gives a count to is priced `row × count` (three
options game-wide, all of them that Forgefiend). The multi-item bundles sum their member rows,
which is the same rule. Read as one flat 5 the model came out 10 points light and the list 20 short
of its own printed total.

**Slot 0 of an option is therefore polymorphic** — an item id, or the full `[[id, count], …]`
set. **`optionItems(o)`/`optionLabel(o, items)` in `rosterEngine.js` are the only readers of that
polymorphism**; anything that unpacks `o[0]` itself loses the second half of a bundle. That is
what `loadoutItemIds`, `wargearNames`, the editor rows and the data-shape tests all go through.

Because a pick is stored as an INDEX into the option list, rewriting the lists renumbered them —
hence `useRosters.js` SCHEMA_VERSION 2, which drops `wg` from rosters saved under v1 rather than
re-interpreting an old index as a different weapon. **v5 and v6 are the same event on a smaller
scale**: the misspelling rule reached exactly two datasheets and the hyphen rule five, so each drops
the picks of those units only — a blanket wipe of every roster's wargear costs far more than it
repairs. A rule of this shape is worth expecting again: when one lands, measure it by regenerating
and diffing the data (option COUNT changing is what renumbers; a count written onto an existing
option does not), and name the datasheets in the migration.

## One bullet, recorded once per miniature

A datasheet bullet that talks about the UNIT ("Any number of models can each have their hallowed
mace replaced…", "For every 5 models in this unit, 1 model's…") is stored by appdata **once per
miniature profile** — a checkbox on the single leader model, a stepper on the rank-and-file one —
because option groups hang off miniatures, not off the datasheet. Rendered straight that is the
same instruction printed twice, and each copy carries its own allowance, so the swap could be
taken twice.

`mergeMiniatureDuplicates` folds them into one group with `all: 1` and **no `m`** (no miniature
owns it, so the editor prints no miniature name). Safety comes from matching the exact
instruction text AND the exact option sets: a leader with a genuinely separate allowance is
always worded differently ("The Sister Superior's boltgun…"), so it never collides; two copies on
the same miniature are left alone. 101 pairs across 50 units.

The text comparison is **whitespace-normalised** — the two copies are typed into appdata twice and
one pair (Deathwatch Terminator Squad) differs by a trailing space — but **not** order-normalised:
a reordered option list is a different statement. What deliberately stays unmerged is a repeated
lead-in with DIFFERENT options: "1 Battle Sister's boltgun can be replaced with one of the
following" appears twice on that datasheet, once for a special weapon and once for a heavy one,
and GW prints it that way too.

It runs **before** the limits below, deliberately — two identical groups are exactly what made a
limited set ambiguous, and folding them first took the ambiguous count from 43 to 1 and the
capped groups from 219 to 261.

**A folded group is spent against the SQUAD** (`swapsByMini`, fixed 2026-08-28). Having no `m`, it
had no profile to charge and so charged nobody: on the 44 datasheets whose swaps are all of this
kind — Chosen, every Terminator squad, Nobz, Scout Squad, Aggressors, Bullgryns, Wracks, Troupe,
Deathwatch Veterans — a swap ADDED the new weapon and never took the old one away. Five accursed
weapons and a power fist on a five-model Chosen squad, identically wrong in the editor's loadout
block, on the card's weapon table, in the print card and in the exported list. (`wargearGroupLive`
and `defaultWargearPoints` had always scoped `all` to the unit, which is why the POINTS were right
all along — only the item accounting was out.)

WHICH profile gave the item up is the one thing the data cannot say: all 105 replaced items in
those groups are carried by BOTH profiles, which is exactly why appdata wrote the bullet twice and
the generator folded it. So the split is a **display convention** — biggest profile first, spilling
into the next once one is spent, never past what a profile fields, and per-profile groups charged
first so they claim their own models. The UNIT total is exact either way, and the total is what the
weapon table counts. `pickMiniFor` puts the pick under the same profile, so the two halves of one
swap read together instead of the champion collecting a fist the squad paid for.

The corpus guardrail is in `src/data/roster/index.test.js`: every unit-wide group with a `rep`, on
every datasheet, must move the unit's total for each replaced item — checked NET, since an option
may hand part of what it replaces straight back (a Deathwatch Veteran keeps his boltgun and gains
an Astartes shield).

## How many models may take it

The other half of the same gap: `wargear_option_group` says WHAT a squad may take, never HOW
MANY models may take it. That lives in its own family — `limited_wargear_choice_set` repeats the
same choices, and `wargear_limit` gives the cap as a step table keyed by unit size
(`{modelCount: 5, choiceLimit: 1}, {modelCount: 10, choiceLimit: 2}` = "for every 5 models,
1 model"), with a `duplicateLimit` that **belongs to the threshold, not to the set** (Cadian
Shock Troops: 2 picks / 1 of a kind at 10 models, 4 / 2 at 20).

Before this the cap was guessed from the instruction text, and the guess was wrong in both
directions — "Up to 4 Dominions can each…" read as no cap at all, "For every 5 models, up to 2
Seraphim" as one. That is not cosmetic: a paid option's points are multiplied by the count, so a
wrong cap misprices the army.

`linkWargearLimits` attaches a set to a group only when its choices are exactly that group's
options (and its miniature, when it names one), no other group on the unit matches equally well,
**and the prose doesn't contradict it** — a set matches by ITEMS, so one describing a wider
allowance over the same weapons would otherwise attach and hand out extra models. That last guard
currently saves exactly one group (Blood Angels' Death Company Marines with Jump Packs: prose says
one model, the table says two), and the run names it. 219 groups end up capped; the 43 ambiguous
and 82 cross-group sets are left alone.

**A set and a group can describe the same picks and still not key the same** (`coversOneToOne`,
added 2026-08-27). The two families disagree about BUNDLES: the Legionaries' special-weapon group
offers "1 plasma pistol and 1 Astartes chainsword" as one pick — which is why appdata's ten option
rows become nine options — while `limited_wargear_choice` records that pick as the plasma pistol
alone. Matching the two on equality lost the cap outright, and the group fell back to one pick for
the whole unit: a 10-model squad could take one special weapon where the datasheet allows two.
A second pass matches each choice to an option that CONTAINS it, one-to-one (Kuhn's, because two
choices sharing their only candidate is what a greedy gets wrong), and runs only where the exact
pass found nothing — an already-ambiguous set stays ambiguous. 9 groups match through it; 263 → 272
capped from the table, and six of those nine stop leaning on the prose fallback for a cap the
table states properly.

**"(duplicates are not allowed)" is a cap too.** appdata leaves `duplicateLimit` empty on the six
sets whose instruction states the rule in words, and `proseNoDuplicates` only knew the "cannot take
duplicates" phrasing — so a squad allowed two picks could take the same weapon twice. Read from the
prose now wherever the table says nothing, never over a duplicate cap appdata itself gave, and
still deaf to `can take duplicates`, which is the opposite statement.

`wargearGroupCap(def, entry, gi)` reads the applicable row from the live model count — **not the
size bracket**, since a 6-10 bracket at 6 models is still below a 10-model threshold. `null` =
no structural cap, keep the old prose-derived behaviour; `{limit: 0}` = the group genuinely
offers nothing at this size ("if this unit contains 10 models…" in a 5-model squad), which the
editor states in words instead of hiding, so an existing pick can still be cleared.

**The cap is what picks the editor's mode**, not appdata's `inputType` alone: a group allowing
several models becomes per-option steppers sharing one budget (`stepMax` = remaining budget,
never more than the duplicate cap), whatever appdata calls it — "Up to 2 Vigilants can each…"
was a checkbox, i.e. one choice for the whole squad. Limit 1 stays the familiar radio/toggle.

**A "for every N models, up to M" instruction is a step table, and the generator reads it as one**
(`SCALED_ALLOWANCE`, 2026-08-27). `proseAllowance` refuses the scaled forms on purpose — they are
not one number — and where appdata records the limited-choice set behind them that refusal is
right: 108 of the 123 groups whose instruction reads this way already carry appdata's own rows, and
only 3 disagree (all reported, appdata's kept). The other **15 carried nothing**, and fell through
to the EDITOR's own fallback, which reads only the "for every 5" half of the sentence and applies it
to each option separately — Grey Knights' "up to 2 Paladins" allowed 2 of *each* option at 10 models
where the datasheet allows 4 for the group. Read into `lim`'s own shape now, one row per threshold
the unit's largest bracket can reach (`[[5,2],[10,4]]`).

The comma in the pattern is load-bearing: a bare **"For every 5 models in this unit:" over a bullet
list** is NOT this. Its bullets are separate allowances, one per weapon named — a Red Corsairs
Raider squad swaps 1 boltgun AND 1 reaver's blade per 5 models — so a single shared table would cap
the pair at what one of them is worth. Two groups are in that shape (Red Corsairs Raiders, Wracks)
and they are the only ones still reaching `stepMax`'s own "for every N" line, where per option is
the right reading.

**The guardrail is a test, not the generator** (`index.test.js`, "every scaled allowance the corpus
states is in the data"): a group whose instruction states this allowance and carries no `lim` fails
the suite by name. A reworded instruction in a future appdata drop, or a regression in the parse,
would otherwise silently hand a squad a different number of special weapons — the generator would
report `+0 from its step form` and nobody would read the line. `--check` (part of `npm run sync`)
covers the other half: the committed data always matches what the generator would write today.

**An UNCAPPED group's budget is shared by its options too** (2026-08-27). `stepMax` subtracted a
group's other rows only where a structural `lim` said what the budget was; where the ceiling came
from the model count instead, every row was handed the whole thing — so a Leman Russ could take all
four of its "this model can be equipped with one of the following" sponson sets, and 83 multi-option
groups on 75 datasheets let a player build past their own limit. `validateRoster` sums the group
exactly the same way and reported the result as `overWargearLimit`, which is the wrong half of the
app to find out from: the "+" is what should have gone dead. Stopping it where the validator draws
its line can never be stricter than the validator, which is what makes the change safe. The LAST
resort (`models × cp`, for a unit-wide group belonging to no profile) keeps its per-row ceiling —
it is a guess, a guess is not something to subtract from, and validateRoster does not police those
groups either.

**A model may swap every COPY of the weapon it gives up** (`cp` on the group,
`wargearGroupFallbackCap` in the engine). Where nothing caps a group, the ceiling used to be one
pick per model of that profile — but a Wraithlord carries two shuriken catapults and may turn both
into flamers, a Ravager three dark lances, a Deff Dread two big shootas and two dread klaws, and a
War Walker two shuriken cannons per model (four in a two-model squad). So the ordinary builds of
five groups were reported illegal and their steppers stopped at one. The generator reads the count
out of the printed loadout, guarded three ways, because the far more common shape is the opposite
one: "this model's 2 twin heavy flamers can be replaced with 2 twin heavy bolters" is ONE pick
granting two items (44 such groups). The guards are the word "each" in the instruction, every
option granting exactly one item, and — where the loadout row is the profile's TOTAL rather than
one model's — dividing by the models that profile fields, which is what keeps a Crisis Starscythe's
"2 burst cannons" (one each for its two Shas'ui) from reading as two per model.

`validateRoster` reports `overWargearLimit` / `overWargearDup` rather than trimming: the editor
caps as you click, so a violation means the list was legal and then the unit shrank, and which
weapon to give up is the player's call.

## A group that waits on another (added 2026-08-27)

A handful of instructions make one group depend on a sibling — "if this model is **not equipped
with** a tachyon arrow, it can be equipped with 1 resurrection orb". appdata carries no structural
link for this (five independent `wargear_option_group` rows on a Chosen, nothing joining them), so
`gen-roster-data.mjs` parses the prose into `cond: [siblingGi, activeFlag]` and
`wargearGroupLive()` is the one place that reads it.

**The condition is about ONE MODEL. The gate is about the unit.** That gap was a real bug until
2026-08-27: any pick in the sibling group closed the dependent one outright. So Chosen lost their
power fist to a single combi-weapon, and the vox-caster, simulacrum, omnispex, banner and medi-pack
left two dozen squads the moment one model swapped its rifle — 61 of the 63 gated groups are on
multi-model units, and a squad has models to spare. A sibling pick now closes the group only once
it has reached EVERY model in scope, counted the way `swapsByMini` counts a swap. Where scope is
one model the two readings coincide, which is why the Overlord still waits for its arrow.

appdata backs that reading where it says anything at all: `loadout_choice_set` enumerates the legal
loadouts of ONE model, and Chosen's list holds both "Power fist + Boltgun + Bolt pistol" and
"Accursed weapon + Combi-weapon + Bolt pistol" while holding no loadout with a combi-weapon and a
power fist together. The exclusion is real and it is per model.

**A closed group is greyed, not removed** (`wargearGroupBlocker` → `UnitEditorFields`'s
`.ues-inert`). It used to disappear, which reads as the editor losing an option and leaves the
reader guessing what to undo. The blocker says which way to move rather than restating the
condition — `need: 'gone'` ("Requires removing: Tachyon arrow, Overlord's blade") when the sibling
REPLACES the named items, `need: 'present'` when it ADDS them and one has to come back. The items
are the sibling's `rep` where it has one, otherwise the option actually picked — never the whole
list of options it offers, which would tell the reader to remove three things when they took one.

## Store

`src/composables/useRosters.js` — module singleton, same pattern as `useTracker.js`/
`useLocale.js`, persisted to `localStorage['wh11ed-rosters']`. Schema-versioned
(`SCHEMA_VERSION`, bump + extend `migrate()` on any shape change). Deliberately imports **no**
faction data files — the list screen must stay in the light entry chunk; only the editor
dynamic-imports the heavy per-faction `src/data/roster/<slug>.js`.

**Drafts.** A roster the creation wizard is still working on carries `draft: true` and
`draftStep`; a saved list carries neither, so "no flag" reads as "saved" and every roster that
predates this is one — no migration. The store hands out the two halves separately
(`savedRosters` / `draftRosters`) so each screen picks one deliberately, and `saveDraft(id)`
(the wizard's "Save") **removes** the flags rather than setting them false, leaving a roster
indistinguishable from one that never was a draft. A draft is real and persisted — that is the
whole point — but it is not a list: it shows only on the Drafts tab of `/roster`, and
`RosterPickerModal` never offers one to a game, because what it holds right now isn't what will
be fielded. The flags never travel: `rosterShare.js`'s `PICK` is a whitelist, so a share link or
a game snapshot carries the army and nothing about how it was made.

**`roster.summary` (`{ points, unitCount, issues }`) is a CACHE**, and `rosterSummary.js` owns the
rules around it. It exists precisely because of the line above: points live in the faction chunk,
and the two screens that show them — `RosterListView` and the tracker's `RosterPickerModal` — must
not load one. So it can only ever be as good as its last writer, and **every screen that changes a
roster while holding its faction data has to write it**: `useRosterEditing` (the editor) and
`RosterCreateView`. That is what went wrong once already — only the editor
wrote it, so a list built end-to-end in the wizard showed "0 pts" on both screens while its own
page priced it correctly. `refreshSummaries()` is the safety net under those writers, called on
mount by both readers: it prices only a roster whose cache is missing or contradicted by its own
unit count (a share-link import, anything older than this mechanism), one faction chunk per
faction involved, and writes straight onto the roster object so the repair doesn't bump
`updatedAt` — the list screen shows that date, and repairing a number is not the user editing.

## Cloud sync (`src/composables/useRosterSync.js`)

Lists sync to `wh11ed-api` (`/rosters`, the same four routes `/games` has), layered over
`useAuth` + `useRosters` exactly the way `useCloudSync.js` layers over the tracker.
`localStorage` stays the primary store; the cloud is a best-effort copy and a failure never
blocks list building. Three rules decide everything in that file, and **none of them is an
accident** — each was a decision:

- **Saved lists only.** A draft never leaves the device (`domain/roster.ts` rejects one with 422
  even if a client bug tried). It isn't a list yet.
- **Uploads follow the Save CLICK, not the edit.** The store autosaves every keystroke locally,
  but the cloud must not collect half-built intermediate versions, so `saveToCloud(id)` is called
  from the deliberate moments — the editor's `save()`, the wizard's `finish()`, a duplicate — and
  from nowhere else. A list edited but not saved simply stays newer on this device; the sync pass
  sees the cloud holds an older copy and **deliberately leaves it alone**. Do not "fix" that by
  pushing every local-newer roster.
- **One request per visit.** `RosterListView`'s `onMounted` runs the single pass: one
  `GET /rosters` returning metadata (no blobs), then only the uploads/downloads that metadata
  proves are needed. There is no manual Sync button, same as the tracker home. A `watch` on the
  auth status runs the same pass again if a session appears while the page is open — signing in
  is possible from here now (see below), and an in-place one has no page load to hide behind.

**Signing in is not on this page, and not on the tracker's either.** Until 2026-09-01 the only
sign-in button in the app sat on the tracker home, and this screen's hint told a signed-out
reader to go there — an instruction, not a control, for an account both sections share. The way
in and out is `AccountMenu.vue` in the navbar (desktop) and the same entries inside the gear menu
(mobile), on every page; `useAccountActions.js` is the pair they share, and it sends the current
path along so the OAuth round trip comes back here. `RosterCloudBar` reports sync and nothing
else.

Conflicts are **last-write-wins on the client's `updatedAt`** (a plain `Date.now()`, so it trusts
the device clock — chosen over a server stamp for cost) and the screen says so afterwards.
`RosterCloudBar.vue` is the only place any of this is visible: on `/roster`, where the pass runs,
and on a saved list's view page, which is where the editor's Save lands — that is how the click
that saved a list gets an answer.

**Deletes are tombstones, and the authoritative one is the server's.** `DELETE /rosters/{id}?at=`
empties the row and stamps it with the deleting device's clock; the list endpoint reports those
graves alongside live lists. That is what makes a delete propagate: without it, the second device
would see an id the cloud lacks, conclude "not backed up yet" and upload the list straight back.
The rules that follow from having both timestamps on one scale:

- A grave **removes the local copy** on every other device (counted in the notice as `removed`).
- A list whose `updatedAt` is **newer than the grave** survives and is re-uploaded — an explicit
  Save after a delete is a statement that this list should exist, and the Save wins.
- A draft is never buried, whatever the cloud says: it was never up there to begin with.

`wh11ed-rosters-deleted` in `localStorage` is now only a **retry queue** for deletes made offline
or signed out. Once the server's listing shows the grave, the local note is dropped — the server
is what keeps the list from coming back. The other set, `wh11ed-rosters-pending`, holds ids whose
save hasn't landed. A saved list the cloud has **never** seen (no row, no grave) is pushed by the
pass regardless of the pending set — that is what makes the first sign-in upload the whole
existing collection, and what eventually uploads a share-link import (`RosterSharedView`
deliberately doesn't upload on the spot: an imported list is unpriced until a screen with faction
data touches it).

## Views (`src/views/tracker/Roster*.vue`, not in this directory)

`RosterListView` (two tabs — saved lists and drafts; a draft card continues the wizard instead
of opening a list that isn't finished, and carries Delete on the card itself: its actions sheet
only ever held that one item, so the kebab was an extra tap for nothing. Saved lists keep the
sheet — they have three things to offer),
`RosterCreateView` (two-step wizard — Setup, then the build panes — mirrors `GameSetup`'s pattern; its "Save" button,
`finish()`, clears the draft flags and lands on the roster's read-only view, not the editor.
**Everything it collects is a draft from the moment a faction is picked** — the first choice that
means anything, and what every later step depends on; before that, opening the wizard and
wandering off leaves no trace. The draft's id goes into the wizard's own URL
(`router.replace` → `/roster/new?draft=<id>`), which is what makes a reload, a back gesture or a
detour resume THIS draft on the step it was left on instead of starting a second one; step 1's
fields and the step index are written through by a watcher, and the units by `syncUnits()` — after
which the wizard and the draft share one array, so per-unit edits ride the store's own autosave. On resume a `?draft=` id pointing at a SAVED roster is ignored: that one belongs to the
editor, and this screen ends in "Save"),
`RosterEditorView` (tabbed — `PageTabs`, the same folder tabs the faction pages and the other two
roster screens use, since 2026-08-28; fixed footer bar — `.rc-sticky`, same class and CSS as
`RosterCreateView.vue`'s own wizard bar, copied not shared — with the points readout + issues
badge on the left and Cancel/Save on the right, always visible across both tabs, not just
one step. "Save" is a pure navigation shortcut to that same read-only view (`save()` →
`/roster/:id/view`) — every edit already autosaves to `useRosters.js`'s reactive store, there's
nothing left to actually persist; "Cancel" is a plain `RouterLink` back to `/roster`, same
non-destructive idea. Reusing the literal `.rc-sticky` class name is load-bearing, not
cosmetic: `App.vue`'s `.app-layout:has(.rc-sticky)` selector — which reserves
`--roster-sticky-h` so `MobileUtilityBar`'s floating buttons rise above this bar instead of
overlapping it — matches by class name alone, regardless of which view rendered it. Those chips
then float over the list pane's bottom-right corner; the pane pads its scroll end by
`--mobile-bar-h` (≤900px, `RosterWorkbench.vue`) so the last unit can be pulled clear, and the
chips' strip is `pointer-events: none` — until 2026-09-19 its empty left half sat over the
catalogue's «Other units» fold and swallowed the tap. **The bar is
full-bleed and its CONTENTS are measured** (`.rc-sticky-inner`, the same 860px + 2rem inner both
`AppSubnav` and `FactionPickerBar` use): the bar is the window's bottom edge, but Save belongs
under the panel it saves, not in the far corner of a 1500px screen),
`RosterViewView` (read-only; **shows what the list breaks at the top** — the same
`validateRoster` verdict as the editor's footer badge, opening the same `RosterIssuesModal`,
because a list is read far more often than it is edited and the reason behind the list page's
warning count used to be two screens away; Units / Rules / Stratagems tabs, the latter two loading faction
rule text via `loadFaction()` from `data/factions/index.js` — **async**, not the old sync
`getFaction()`, see below — on first open of either tab, sharing one fetch since a detachment
object carries both `.rule` and `.stratagems`). Its Stratagems tab is deliberately the same
setup as the standalone `/stratagems` page (`StratagemsView.vue`): the by-phase/as-list toggle
(same `localStorage['wh11ed-stratagems-by-phase']` key, so the preference is shared, not
learned twice), phase accordions via `stratagemPhases.js`'s `phasesOf`/`phaseLabel`/
`PHASE_ORDER`, and the same masonry `.strat-grid` — just pre-filtered to the roster's own
detachments (flattened, no filter row) instead of that page's core/you/opp filter.

Its **Units tab** shows the base statline as small chamfered plates (`.rvst`/`.rvst-box`,
scaled-down copies of `DatasheetCard.vue`'s own `.ds-stat`/`.ds-stat-box`), invulnerable save
as its own trailing accent-coloured plate (`.rvst-inv`, last — not DatasheetCard's own
shield-under-SV layout, no room for that in a one-line row). Clicking a row opens
`RosterUnitRulesModal` (same as `RosterUnitBrowser`'s own row-click preview while adding units)
with the unit's full, unfiltered datasheet — an inline accordion with a
`loadoutSheetOf`-filtered/merged card was tried (weapons trimmed to the entry's actual loadout,
Leader+Bodyguard combined into one card) and reverted: it read as visually nested/padded rather
than one card, and the merged-unit case looked worse than just showing each datasheet in full.
If this is revisited, check git history around 2026-08 for what didn't work before repeating it.
**Its header carries one "…" instead of an icon per action** (2026-08-28): Export (the same
`RosterExportModal` the editor and the list page open), Print (`/roster/:id/print`) and **Copy the
whole list** — one tap, GW-app dialect, straight to the clipboard, for the player who does not want
to choose a format first. Both writing actions are disabled until the faction bundle is in
(`ready`), because a list exported a beat early is a list with no army in it; a blocked clipboard
falls back to opening the export dialog, which holds the same text in a selectable textarea. Only
off the table — in a game this screen reads the game's snapshot and there is nothing to do with it.
The sheet itself is the app's shared `.act-list`/`.act-btn` (root `CLAUDE.md`, "What is global").

**`.hdr-icon` is a fixed square with `font: inherit`** on both this screen and the editor. The
pencil is a `RouterLink` and the "…" is a `<button>`, and a `<button>` starts from the browser's
own 13px system font — the same padding drew two visibly different boxes side by side. Whichever
element an action happens to need is not a style.

**Its Rules tab runs a step smaller and tighter than a rules page** (2026-08-28). It is a REREAD at
the table, not a first reading, so `.rv-rules` re-sizes `--fs-rule-title` / `--fs-subheading` —
inherited custom properties, which is how it reaches inside `RuleBlock` without touching its scoped
styles — and overrides body type and paragraph gaps through `:deep()`. Those overrides go through
the `.rv-rule-block` wrapper on purpose: a bare `.rv-rules :deep(.rule-body)` **ties** RuleBlock's
own rule on specificity (0,2,0 each) and would be settled by chunk order.

`RosterSharedView` (import landing for a `rosterShare.js` link).

**The creation wizard's way back is its own problem, and it is solved outside the wizard.**
Leaving mid-build is normal use — the question a half-built list raises ("what does this detachment actually do?") is
answered on a page that isn't this one — and the draft survives that on its own. What didn't
survive was the route home: `/roster` opens on the **Saved** tab, so a reader returning through
the nav saw a list without their roster in it and concluded it was gone. `RosterCreateView`
therefore notes its draft id in `useRosterDraftResume.js` as it unmounts (and drops it on the way
in, whichever door was used); `App.vue` re-checks the roster is still a draft — it may have been
saved or deleted while the chip was up — and `MobileUtilityBar` floats a "to roster" chip over
whatever the reader went off to read, linking at `?draft=<id>` so the wizard resumes THAT list.
That memory is deliberately **in-memory and session-scoped, not "a draft exists"**: a draft can
sit on the Drafts tab for weeks, and pinning a chip to every page until someone deletes it would
be nagging rather than helping. A relaunch doesn't need it either — the stored last route now
carries the wizard's own `?draft=` (see the PWA section of the root `CLAUDE.md`). **Mobile only**,
same as the "back to game" chip it mirrors; desktop has no floating-resume surface for either.

**A list name can be a whole quote, and usually is.** listhammer/GW exports name a list with its
epigraph ("I am Warpbane-- and I could kill you...but death would only end your agony--and silence
your shame."), which at the view header's 1.7rem display size ran five lines down a phone screen
and left the points and the pencil floating against the middle of the text.

Two separate answers, and the split matters. **Placement is fixed: one row, never stacked**
(2026-08-28). `.rv-head` is `flex-wrap: nowrap` — the points and the "…" keep the top-right corner,
the name takes the rest and wraps ITS OWN text down as many lines as it needs. Two earlier shapes
were rejected by the person using the screen: an unconditional column below 700px (which put
"2000/2000" under a two-word name), then a wrapping row with a `12rem` threshold on the name, which
did the same thing on a phone because the meta alone is over half that width. Deciding it from the
TEXT was tried and reverted twice before those, and is still wrong: at phone width "PORTRAIT OF A
MACHINE" is 21 characters and two lines while a longer lowercase name is one.
**Alignment is `baseline`, not `center`**: the points sit beside the name's FIRST line, so a
quote-as-a-name doesn't leave them floating against the middle of a five-line paragraph — which is
the original complaint that started this whole header.
**Size is** decided from the name, by `utils/rosterNameFit.js` → `'' | 'long' | 'xlong'` at 60 and
100, counting a capital as 1.4 lowercase letters wide (an ALL-CAPS name is not a short one). The
bucket is a class on both the view header's `h1` and the editor's name input, and steps down with
`clamp(…, vw, …)` so a desktop keeps the full size. Two lines keep the full size — the step is for
a wall of text, not for a name that merely wraps.

Nothing is truncated on those two screens — the name IS the header. Places where the name is only
a label truncate instead: the list card and the picker row clamp to two lines, and the tracker's setup cards/history pills were fixed separately
(`minmax(0, 1fr)`, see `components/tracker/CLAUDE.md`).

## Components (this directory)

`RosterUnitBrowser` (add-unit list/search), `RosterUnitList` (the roster's own list, shared by the
editor and the wizard — see Editing flow) and `RosterUnitRow` (one entry's collapsed line inside
it), `UnitEditorFields` (wargear/enhancement/warlord
pick UI for one unit), `WeaponProfileModal`, `EnhancementRuleModal` (loads the enhancement's
rule text via `loadFaction()`, same as `RosterViewView`), `RosterIssuesModal` (renders
`validateRoster()`'s issues), `RosterExportModal` (wraps `rosterExport.js`),
`RosterUnitRulesModal` (wraps `DatasheetCard` with its `collapsible` prop — see Known gaps;
used both by `RosterUnitBrowser`'s row-click preview while adding units and by
`RosterViewView`'s Units tab — see Views above; takes an optional `ctx` for the modifier
overlay, see below),
`RosterPrintSheet` + `RosterPrintFragment` + `RosterPrintUnitCard` + `RosterPrintCard` (the
printable document, a slice of one of its blocks, one unit's tier choice, and paper's own card
typography — see "Printing a list"),
`RosterRulesPanel` (the folded rules panel above the build panes — see "Faction rules beside the
build"),
`FactionAccentScope` (per-faction accent-color CSS custom-property scope for the editor
chrome, keyed off the roster's faction slug),
`ConditionChips` (the one way a condition switch is drawn — see "Live rules" below; purely
presentational, the parent decides what a flip means).

**The card's blocks in the modal start OPEN** (2026-08-27, `DsAccordion`'s `startOpen`, default
`true`). `collapsible` folds Abilities / Wargear Abilities / Special Abilities / ability sets /
named rules / Damaged / Transport / Leader-Support / Composition / Options into accordions, and all
ten used to arrive closed — so reading a unit's abilities cost a tap on every group, every time the
card was opened, on the one screen a player actually reads a datasheet from. The standalone
datasheet page has never hidden any of them (`collapsible` is false there). The chevrons stay: a
block that has been read can be folded out of the way, it just isn't the state the card arrives in.

Two accordions still start closed, and both are the same exception — they are not the printed
datasheet: **«possible modifiers»** (a speculative list of what would change, see Modifier overlay
below) and each **rule block's own prose** in `RosterUnitRulesModal` (`.rum-rule`), where opening
them all at once dumps four long detachment/enhancement rules on top of the card they annotate.

**`RosterUnitRulesModal`'s `.modal-body` cancels `DatasheetCard`'s own ≤480px `.ds-card`
full-viewport bleed** (`width: 100vw; margin-left: calc(50% - 50vw)`) via a `:deep(.ds-card)`
override. That escape is correct only when `.ds-card` sits directly in an unpadded container —
nested in `.modal-body`'s own `0.35rem` side padding, the `50%` term resolves against that
padded box instead of the true viewport, so the escape lands a few px short/long and the modal
gains a small horizontal scroll (most visible once a unit has an Abilities/Special Abilities
group — `DsAccordion`'s `.ds-group-btn`, `width: 100%`, then measures against
`.ds-ability-group`'s own edge-bled, now-over-wide box). `.ds-card`'s *internal*
bleed-to-its-own-edge for the header/weapon-table/ability-group zones is untouched and stays
correct once `.ds-card` itself is back to a normal in-flow block — only the escape-to-viewport
part is cancelled.

**`RosterUnitRulesModal` themes itself with `FactionAccentScope`, wrapped inside its own
`.modal-body`** rather than by the caller wrapping the whole component (the way
`UnitEditorFields.vue` does for `WeaponProfileModal`/`EnhancementRuleModal`). It has to be — this
component's own `BaseModal` already teleports to `<body>`, so a second `<Teleport>` a caller puts
*around* it (as `UnitEditorFields.vue` does for `rulesOpen`) re-parents the actual modal DOM to
`<body>` a second time, right past the outer `FactionAccentScope`'s wrapping `div` — CSS custom
properties only cascade through real DOM ancestry, not the logical component tree, so that outer
wrap never reaches the card (confirmed empirically: `.modal-overlay`'s `--accent` stayed the
app's default red there, while `.modal-body`'s own nested scope was correctly Ork green). Scoping
it inside `.modal-body` keeps it a genuine ancestor of `DatasheetCard` with no teleport in
between, so it works for all three places this modal opens from (`RosterUnitBrowser`'s preview,
`RosterViewView`'s Units tab, and `UnitEditorFields`' "Show datasheet" link) without depending on
what the caller does.

**`getFaction()` doesn't exist anymore** — `src/data/factions/index.js` was refactored
(async, code-split `loadFaction(slug)`) after this feature's early commits; `RosterViewView.vue`
and `EnhancementRuleModal.vue` were updated to `await loadFaction(slug)` when `main` was
merged in (2026-08-03). If you find another `getFaction` call site while extending this
feature, it's stale — same fix.

**`BaseModal` renders via `<Teleport to="body">`** (added on `main` after this feature's
early modal work) — any new test mounting a component that renders `BaseModal` (or a wrapper
around it, like `RosterUnitRulesModal`) must assert against `new DOMWrapper(document.body)`,
not the mounted wrapper's own `.text()`/`.find()` — the teleported content lives outside the
wrapper's DOM subtree. See `RosterUnitRulesModal.test.js` or
`src/components/tracker/modals.test.js` for the pattern.

## Modifier overlay (`src/composables/rosterModifiers.js`)

`RosterUnitRulesModal` renders the sheet a roster ENTRY fields, not the printed one, via
`overlaySheet(sheet, ctx)` — a pure function alongside the other `roster*.js` composables.
`ctx` (`{ def, entry, items, detachments, leaderTargets, units }`) is optional and partial —
each call site passes only what it alone knows, and the modal adds `unitId`/`factionSlug` from
its own props. `RosterUnitBrowser`'s preview passes only `detachments`: the unit isn't in the
roster yet, so there is no loadout to reflect, but the roster's detachments already apply. No ctx
at all → the printed sheet with every option, exactly the pre-overlay behaviour.

Tier A does four things:

1. **Trims the weapon tables** to the entry's actual loadout (2000 of 5038 rows across all
   factions disappear from a freshly-added unit's card) **and stamps how many of each weapon the
   entry fields** — `qty` on the row, rendered by `DatasheetCard` as a muted `×N` after the name
   (850 rows on 431 units at the default loadout). One pass for both, because it is one question:
   which item is this row, and how many of it does the unit hold.
   The count is the UNIT's, not one model's — per-model isn't even well defined on a
   multi-miniature datasheet, where a Sister Superior and her nine Sisters hold the same boltgun
   as two separate `defaults` rows. The unit total is defined for every shape, moves with the
   unit's size, and is what the reader is about to roll.
   It is matched BY NAME like the trim, so it leans on a name meaning one weapon inside one unit.
   That holds today and is asserted in two places — `src/data/roster/index.test.js` (no unit def
   interns a wargear name to two item ids) and `src/data/datasheets/index.test.js` (no datasheet
   lists a weapon name twice). appdata does publish 316 names with more than one profile set (an
   Ork Boy's Choppa against a Nob's), but never twice on the same datasheet; those tests are the
   tripwire for the release where that stops being true. An unknown count says nothing at all —
   `null` rather than a guess, the same asymmetry the trim itself uses.
2. **Resolves rule-granted keywords** — the existing `conditionalKeywords.json` sidecar, gated on
   the ROSTER's detachments instead of `useFactionChoice`, handed to `DatasheetCard`'s existing
   `grantedKeywords` prop. Detachment names are matched to sidecar ids by
   `slugify(name.normalize('NFD') minus combining marks)` — **not the shared `slugify()` alone**,
   which drops the diaeresis in "Dëlve Assault Shift" and silently misses that grant (24/25
   without the strip, 25/25 with it). `slugify()` itself is load-bearing for DOM ids and the
   search index, so it stays as it is. `grantedKeywordsFor`/`detKey` themselves live in
   `rosterEngine.js` (re-exported here) since 2026-08-24: the same grant decides whether a unit can
   carry an enhancement, and the engine cannot import this file without a cycle.
   **The mark an entry chose for itself is one of these grants and must travel in the same SHAPE**
   (`{ kw, detName, extra, alleg }`). It did not, until 2026-08-28: `allegKeyword` answers with a
   bare string — which is right for the engine's own keyword lists (`rosterValidation`, the
   editors' `canWarlord`) and wrong here — so every reader took `.kw` off a string and got
   `undefined`, and `rosterUnitCard`'s `allGrantedKeywords` THREW on it. A computed that throws
   inside a template renders nothing, so the unit's card came up blank: no statline, no abilities,
   nothing, on screen and on paper alike. Both Daemon Princes and the Soul Grinder choose a
   Daemonic Allegiance and it is mandatory, so those five were broken outright; 87 more datasheets
   join them whenever the detachment that offers their mark is fielded (Pactbound Zealots is 43 of
   them, Headhunter Task Force 25). The footnote has a source of its own — `alleg` carries the
   choice's title, and `keywordNotesOf` says "from this unit's own Daemonic Allegiance choice"
   rather than crediting the faction for what the reader picked.
3. **Hides the build-choice blocks** — Unit Composition, the default-loadout sentence and Wargear
   Options (`DatasheetCard`'s `hideChoices` prop). Each describes a decision the roster has already
   made, and the printed loadout sentence contradicts the weapon tables once those are trimmed.
   The Leader "can be attached to" list is deliberately KEPT: it is rules text about how the
   attachment works, and it stays useful for an entry that hasn't been attached yet.
4. **Reports roster facts absent from the datasheet** (`entryContext`) as chips above the card:
   Warlord, the enhancement carried (chosen or mandatory), and what the unit is attached to.
   An attachment is only shown when `leaderTargets` can resolve it to a name — never as a uid.

Tier B adds attributed prose INSIDE the card, in `DatasheetCard`'s `#before-keywords` slot —
directly above its closing Keywords line, so the roster context reads as part of the datasheet
rather than as an appendix after it (the slot exists for exactly this; the card itself stays
unaware of the roster). `ruleSourcesFor` says WHICH rules bear on the entry and the modal resolves
each to its text from the lazily-imported faction bundle: the enhancement carried, each of the
roster's detachment rules, and the abilities of any Leader attached to this unit.

**The block is not itself an accordion** — what applies is always visible and only the individual
rule bodies collapse, so there is one level of chevrons and opening it can't dump four long rule
bodies at once. It is marked as not-printed-on-the-card by borrowing the card's own vocabulary for
a block of a different kind (`.ds-damaged`'s left accent bar) plus a **dashed** border and an
accent-text heading instead of the printed groups' solid accent bar with white text. Everything
keys off `--accent`, so it holds in all 30 faction colours and both themes; introducing a fixed
hue would fight them.

**The army rule is deliberately NOT one of these blocks.** It opens from the card's own
`Faction:` line, which becomes a clickable `.keyword` exactly like a core ability and shows the
rule in the same `KeywordPopover` (`useKeywordPopover`'s `openRule`, added for a caller that
already holds the text). That line is the datasheet's own statement of which army rule it has, so
it beats anything this layer could infer — and the 128 sheets with no faction line (Anathema
Psykana, Aeldari wraith constructs, aircraft) correctly offer nothing to open, because they
genuinely don't have one. The card takes the openable names in `linkedFactionRules` and matches
them against the comma-separated parts of `sheet.faction` apostrophe-insensitively ("Martial
Ka’tah" vs "Martial Ka'tah"); unmatched parts stay plain text.

Detachment rules are gated by **`src/composables/ruleTargets.js`** — the keyword layer.
A rule almost always names its own target ("Speed Freeks units from your army…", "friendly
ADEPTUS CUSTODES TERMINATOR models"), so the gate is read from the same string that renders and
can never drift from it, which a generated sidecar eventually would. **Always fed the ENGLISH
body** (`rulesFactionEn` in the modal): keywords stay English but the prose around them is
translated, so gating the RU text would silently stop matching.

Read that file's header before touching the patterns. **The design is fail-open on purpose** —
wrongly hiding a rule is much worse than wrongly showing one — with three independent escapes:
a rule that never mentions your own units isn't gated; a rule where ANY passage talks about your
units without naming a keyword isn't gated (this is what saves multi-part rules like Aeldari's
Battle Focus, which names VEHICLE in one of five triggers and would otherwise vanish for every
infantry unit); and an extraction matching no unit in the whole faction is distrusted and ignored
(7 rules, prose abbreviating a faction keyword — "Votann units" against LEAGUES OF VOTANN).

A rule is read as one `{ targets, excludes }` **per statement** — paragraph, `###` section or
`▪ ` bullet — and applies when ANY statement does. Splitting by bullet is load-bearing: Necrons'
Cold Fervour is two bullets, the first naming DESTROYER CULT and the second every other NECRONS
model except MONSTER, and merging them would let the second bullet's exclusion cancel the first
bullet's own target. Exclusions are safe by nature — one that names no keyword ("excluding
Battle-shocked units") excludes nobody. Four wordings the patterns must keep handling, each of
which silently ungated whole rules before it was covered: a sentence-opening `Friendly` (spelled
`[Ff]riendly`, NOT the /i flag, which would also make the keyword pattern's capitalisation
case-insensitive and destroy the one signal that marks a keyword), a slash alternation
("Immortals/Necron Warriors units"), a parenthetical between the noun and "from your army", and
singular/plural drift both ways (rules say "Vyper units", the datasheet keyword is VYPERS).

Measured across all 30 factions: 225 of 268 detachment rules are gated, 30 of them carry an
exclusion, 41% of (unit, rule) pairs are hidden, and no unit is left seeing none of its faction's
rules. **Re-run that measurement after touching the patterns** — the numbers are the only way to
tell a sharper gate from a wrongly-hiding one.

An earlier attempt to gate the army rule on the datasheet's own `faction` ability line was
measured and rejected — 712 of 1039 sheets match, 22 distinct mismatch classes, 128 sheets with
no such field — because wh11ed's single `armyRule` object is not 1:1 with a sheet's faction
ability line. Don't retry it; that is what `sync-army-rule-coverage` exists for.

The enhancement and Leader blocks are gated structurally instead (bearer, and the unit joined),
so they never go through this layer, and the army rule no longer needs it at all.

Name matching across the two datasets is centralised here: `enhKey()` (moved out of
`EnhancementRuleModal.vue`, which now imports it, so the two lookups can't drift) and `detKey()`.

Two rules make the weapon trim safe, and **neither is cosmetic** — read before changing the
matching:

- **A row no wargear item claims is never hidden.** 2.8% of real weapon rows (139 of 5038) match
  no item name — a fixed weapon spelled differently from its item, or a profile with no item at
  all. Hiding those would delete a weapon the unit really has.
- **A multi-miniature datasheet only ever gains rows, never loses them.** A `rep` list is
  per-miniature and there's no single squad count to spend it against, so the subtraction
  accounting (mirrored from `rosterEngine.js`'s `defaultLoadoutLines()`) is restricted to
  single-miniature units, exactly as that function does.

An empty ranged table on a freshly-added unit is usually CORRECT, not a bug — 26 datasheets
(Nemesis Dreadknight, Wraithknight with Ghostglaive, Canoness with Jump Pack…) have a default
loadout with no ranged weapon at all, and every gun on their card is an option nobody picked yet.

### Tier C — the numbers themselves

`src/data/rosterModifiers/<slug>.js` (generated skeletons + hand-read `effects`) →
`src/composables/rosterStatMods.js` (pure) → `DatasheetCard`'s `statMarks`/`statNotes` props.

**An unconditional modifier rewrites the printed value and marks it with `*`; a conditional one
never touches the number and is annotated instead.** That asymmetry is the whole point: most 40k
modifiers are conditional, and a card reading T6 when the +1 only holds while a Waaagh! is running
is worse than one reading T5 with a note. A value the layer cannot compute honestly ("D6+2" plus
1) degrades to an annotation rather than inventing arithmetic — see `applyValue`.

**Eight kinds of source feed it**: army rules, detachment rules, enhancements, allegiance abilities —
and, since 2026-08-22, a DATASHEET's own abilities, its WARGEAR, the CORE RULES and STRATAGEMS. The last two are where most of
the game's numbers actually live: 436 ability candidates and 136 wargear ones, all reviewed.

**Wargear** (`kind: 'wargear'`, from appdata's `datasheet.wargear[].ruleText`) is an item, not a
rule, so it applies only once the entry actually TOOK it: `ctx.itemNames` is the set of normalised
item names the loadout fields (`loadoutItemNames`), and `ref.item` is matched against it. Without
that a Storm Shield's 4+ invulnerable would print on every model that could have taken one. `null`
itemNames — the add-unit preview, which cannot know the loadout — shows nothing rather than
everything: unlike a weapon row there is no printed line being hidden. Five items read "while the
bearer is leading a unit" and carry `target: 'led'`, answered from `ctx.leaderItemNames`.

**A lesson from the same day:** the candidate heuristic had no pattern for `has a Move
characteristic of 7"` — a SET rather than a delta, and the wording nearly every wargear rule uses.
68 records were invisible for that reason alone, including the one that started the hunt (a
Mortifier taking an Anchorite Sarcophagus and its stats not moving). If a rule that plainly changes
a number has no record, suspect the wording before the pipeline.

**Stratagems** (`kind: 'stratagem'`) are the largest source of all — 1427 across the game, 423
candidates, all reviewed — and the only one that is not a standing fact. A stratagem is SPENT: on one
unit, for a stated window, when the player decides to. So:

- The record carries **`dur`** (`phase` / `turn` / `round` / `battle`), read from its own prose.
  Expiry is the same stamp comparison a switch uses, so a stratagem spent in the Shooting phase
  stops rewriting the card in the Fight phase without anyone remembering to turn it off. **`phase`
  is the default and the overwhelming majority** (234 of 264 records with effects): a stratagem with
  no stated window lasts until the end of the phase. `round` is for the windows that outlive the
  player turn — "until the start of your next Command phase" (11 records) and "until the end of the
  battle round" (1) — where `turn` would drop a defensive buff exactly when it matters, during the
  opponent's turn; it still errs EARLY against the true window, which is the standing preference.
  Where one stratagem states two windows (Sororitas' To the Heart of Heresy: Strength for the turn,
  AP for the phase) the record takes the one that covers its effects; there is no per-effect `dur`,
  and nothing needs one so far.
- **A stratagem's own timing is enforced on the chips too** (`blockedBy: 'wrongPhase'`): its WHEN
  line names the phase, and often the side ("Your opponent's Shooting phase"), which `phasesOf` /
  `phaseSidesOf` already read for the Stratagems tab's "usable now" filter. `resolveModifierEntries`
  attaches the pair to the record as `slot` — the one pass holding both the record and the faction
  data it was read from — and the chip is dimmed, not hidden: holding Armour of Contempt for the
  opponent's Shooting phase is worth knowing. One already in force is never blocked, whatever phase
  it is now.
- **A blocked chip has to LOOK blocked, and say why on itself** (fixed 2026-08-23, reported as
  "why don't these stratagems press?"). It was `disabled` and carried its reason in `title` — but
  the only style on it was `cursor: default`, which is nothing at all on the screen this is read on,
  and a `title` never opens under a finger. So an inert chip was pixel-identical to a live one.
  `ConditionChips` now dims it and dashes its border, and writes the reason on a second line inside
  the chip — but only the reasons that belong to that ONE chip (`wrongPhase`, `usedPhase`); the
  block-wide two (Battle-shock, the unit already targeted) stay in the header above the group, where
  they are said once instead of on every chip.
- **The two per-phase limits of 15.01 are enforced on the chips** (`stratagemsFor` → `blockedBy`):
  a unit already targeted this phase blocks every other stratagem on its card (`unitPhase`), and a
  stratagem already used this phase — on this unit or another — blocks itself (`usedPhase`). Both
  compare the stamp a stratagem was SPENT at against the current one, never its duration: a
  turn-long stratagem spent in the Movement phase is still in force in the Shooting phase and is no
  obstacle to spending another one there. **Only where the game keeps phases**: without a phase
  clock every stamp is a bare round, "the same phase" is unanswerable, and blocking a whole round
  would forbid play the rules allow. The "unless otherwise stated" stratagem that may legally double
  up has an escape hatch — un-spend the other one, which is never blocked.
- **Being spent IS the condition**, so a stratagem's effects need no `cond` — `activeStrats` (the
  set of record ids the player says are up, from `player.ctx.strats[uid]`) answers it. A `cond` on
  top is for what the stratagem asks BEYOND being spent ("…against MONSTER targets"), and those stay
  footnotes exactly as they would anywhere else.
- State lives in `player.ctx.strats[uid][sid]`, apart from `ctx.units`: several stratagems can be up
  at once, they are alternatives to nothing, and they are keyed by record rather than by condition.
- The chips are on the unit's card, above the datasheet — that is where the number they change is,
  and choosing a unit is the whole point of spending one. The Stratagems tab is unchanged.
- **Its EFFECT has no keyword gate** (`SCOPELESS`): it addresses whichever unit it was spent on
  ("until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack…"), and which one
  that was is the player's to say.
- **Its TARGET does** (`targetScopes`, added 2026-08-27). WHICH units may be picked is not a
  judgement call, it is the stratagem's own TARGET line — "One DAMNED unit from your army that has
  not been selected to shoot this phase" — so `resolveModifierEntries` reads it through the same
  `ruleScopes()` the rest of this layer uses, and `gateStratagems()` drops the record for a unit
  that cannot be that target. Chaos Cult is the detachment that made it plain: five of its six
  stratagems are DAMNED-only, and every Legionaries squad in the list was carrying "-1 AP · Crazed
  Focus" under POSSIBLE MODIFIERS. Kept in a field of its own rather than in `scopes`, because the
  two questions are judged against different keyword sets:
  - **the target is judged against the ATTACHED unit's keywords** — Core Rules 19.03, "an attached
    unit has all of the keywords of all of its component units, [and] is affected by any rule that
    applies to units with any of those keywords". A Chaos Lord leading a Cultist Mob is standing in
    a DAMNED unit, so his card offers the DAMNED stratagems too (`attachedUnitKeywords()`, which
    reads the attachment the roster already records — a bodyguard can hold a Leader and a Support
    at once, and all three are one unit).
  - **after the keyword grants, never before**: Necrons' The Spoor of Frailty targets DESTROYER
    CULT and the Destroyer Ankh is what grants it, so gating on the printed keywords alone would
    hide the stratagem from the one unit it was written for. That ordering is why the gate runs in
    the views (`modContextFor` / `gatedModifiers`) rather than inside `resolveModifierEntries`,
    where the granted keywords are not known yet.
  - **fail-open as everywhere else**: a target line naming no unit of yours (every stratagem aimed
    at an enemy) gates nothing, and one naming a keyword no datasheet in the faction carries is
    assumed misread. Measured across all 30 factions: 216 of 298 stratagem records yield a target
    scope, 12 fall through the "matched nobody" escape (a detachment-granted keyword the datasheets
    do not print — SOUL FORGE, SHADOW LEGION, TANK ACE — or prose our patterns cannot read, "One
    Avatar of Khaine model"), and 44.8% of (unit, stratagem) pairs are dropped.
  - **"TARGET: That … unit." is a back-reference** (added 2026-09-19, `stratagemTargetScopes`): 80
    of the 308 stratagems with a modifier name their unit in the WHEN line ("when a friendly
    HERETIC ASTARTES INFANTRY FLY unit … is selected to fight") and point at it from the TARGET
    line, which `ruleScopes` reads as nobody — so all 80 were offered to the whole army, and a
    player found Plunging Talons under his Terminators and Seize the Prize (whose "excluding
    MONSTERS and VEHICLES" is in its WHEN line) under his Defiler. For a "That …" target the WHEN
    line is the statement of the target, exclusions and all; the target line read as "Friendly …"
    is the fallback; a model "in that unit" is the same back-reference. A TARGET line that names
    its unit without "from your army" ("One GREY KNIGHTS unit that was selected as the target of
    …", "One friendly unengaged HARLEQUINS unit") is about your own unit by construction, so a line
    ruleScopes reads as nobody is read once more with "Friendly" in place of its opening count —
    never past a lowercase "enemy". Measured over ALL 1329 stratagem lines (not only the 308 with
    a modifier): 1284 → 1323 read; the 6 left ("Your NECRONS WARLORD", "Select one of those Cult
    Ambush markers", "Your army's Favoured Champions unit") stay fail-open. Over the 308 with a
    modifier, (unit, stratagem) pairs dropped went 33.4% → 45.7%; the per-stratagem visible sets
    were diffed by hand (67 changed, every one narrower or wider in the direction the print says —
    Shield of Faith to all of ADEPTA SORORITAS rather than the 4 JUMP PACK units its "or" clause
    named). Shared with ruleTargets.js: `[gloss:…]` links unwrapped like `[core:…]`, "friendly
    unengaged/engaged X", a spaced slash as an in-phrase alternation ("Infantry / Mounted Thousand
    Sons Psyker" = INFANTRY-PSYKER or MOUNTED-PSYKER), "Battle-shocked" as a stop word, a slash
    list inside "excluding". NOT shared: "in your army" is not an own-side marker — "within your
    army's Power Matrix" contains it and would ungate 9 detachment rules through escape 2.
  - the gated list is what the CARD and the CHIPS are both built from (`RosterViewView`'s
    `gatedFor`), so a stratagem that is not on offer cannot appear as a chip, as a note, or as a
    condition switch its `cond` would otherwise have named.

**Ability sets** (`subAbilities` in appdata, added 2026-08-23) are the ninth thing a record can hang
off — and until then the generator walked straight past them. A set is "at the start of the battle
round, select up to two of the abilities in the Relics of the Matriarchs section; until the start of
the next battle round this model has those abilities": the PARENT's prose is the picking
instruction and changes no number, and the options that do live under it. 16 sets across the game,
52 options, 16 of which touch a characteristic — one of them is why the Triumph of Saint Katherine's
card showed nothing at all. **EVERY option gets a record**, whether or not it changes a number (the generator's `always` flag —
the only source exempt from `isCandidate`): a set showing two of its six options is a tally nobody
can read, and following the choice is the whole point of these chips. 52 records, 16 of them with
effects.

**Which option is up is a CHOICE, not a condition** — the same shape as a spent stratagem, and
deliberately not vocabulary:

- state lives in `player.ctx.picks[uid][sid]`, keyed by the option's own record, stamped when it
  was picked and lasting the **battle round** every set's wording gives it;
- the cap is the set's own size (`ref.pickLimit`, read from the parent's "select up to two"), and
  `setUnitPick` evicts the oldest pick when a full set gains one — the store never learns what a
  set IS, the caller passes the siblings;
- the effects carry **no `cond`**: `effectLive`'s `byChoice` treats a stratagem and a set option
  alike, and `applyStatMods` gates them whether or not they carry a `when` (a reviewer leaving it
  null must not turn the gate off);
- **picks are read army-wide** (`allPicks`): 15 of the 16 sets are on a unique model, and a relic
  picked on the Triumph feeds an aura landing on the Sisters, whose own `ctx.picks` know nothing
  about it. The Drukhari Raider is the one non-unique exception and would share one choice between
  two of them — the price of not threading the source entry through every apply pass.

The chips are **on the unit's row** (behind the chevron, with its states and auras): the choice
belongs to that model. Each carries `from` (`{ owner, ability, set, unit }`), which
`RosterViewView.withRuleInfo` turns into what a reader needs — the group headed by **the unit and
the set**, the chip **named the way that unit's card names it** (the RU overlay's translation, via
the `ruleInfo` map — abilities, sets and options, keyed by their ENGLISH name), and an **"i"**
opening the rule text in the same popover a core ability uses. **A button that opens that popover
itself must carry `data-kw-open`** (`opensPopover`, checked by App.vue's document listener): that
listener's job is "a click anywhere else closes the popover", and the opener's own click bubbles
straight into it — without the marker the popover opens and shuts in one tap, which is exactly what
the chips' "i" did. Aura chips carry the same three, for
the same reason: they name a rule printed on somebody else's card.

**Auras** (`target: 'aura'`) are the first modifier that reaches a unit the record was not printed
on. Three answers, and only one of them is a question for the player:

- **The bearer's own unit — free.** Core Rules 22.01: "while a model with an aura ability is on the
  battlefield, it is always within range of its own aura ability." No chip, no range, nothing to
  ask.
- **The unit the bearer is attached to (and, from the other side, a Character standing in an aura's
  unit) — also free**: the model is inside that unit, at 0". Read from the attachment the roster
  already records.
- **Anybody else — a chip on that unit's row**, behind the chevron next to Battle-shock, because it
  is a distance on the table and only the player can see it. Offered only while the aura's own rule
  is actually running (`aurasReaching`'s `active`): an unselected relic changes nothing, and a
  switch that moves no number is what this layer refuses to show anywhere else. State lives in `player.ctx.auras[uid][sid]` — keyed by
  the RECORD, like a spent stratagem, since an aura is a relationship with another model rather
  than a state of this one — and lasts a **battle round** (`activeAuras`): what starts and stops an
  aura is movement, and asking again every phase would be a tap per unit per phase.

Two things make auras different from every other ability record:

- **They are keyword-gated.** "A friendly ADEPTA SORORITAS unit within 6" of this model" says
  nothing about the Rhino beside it, so the aura is the one ability that does NOT get the
  `SCOPELESS` pass. The gate travels on the record as `ref.scopes`, derived from the prose by the
  generator (`auraRef` → `ruleScopes`) because the record itself stores no prose to read it from in
  the browser; re-derived every run, so it cannot drift from the wording. Prose the extractor
  cannot read leaves it absent and the effect applies ungated — the same fail-open direction
  `ruleTargets.js` takes everywhere.
- **Which chips are offered is `aurasReaching()`**: the source must be a DIFFERENT entry of this
  same roster, the unit must pass that keyword gate, and the automatic cases above are excluded —
  otherwise every unit's row grows a chip for every aura in the game.
- **A DETACHMENT RULE's aura is the exception to "a different entry"**: its carrier is named by
  keyword, not by datasheet, so the chip is headed by the detachment and offered once to every unit
  the rule reaches. Its gate is read off the reach clause alone and may not fail open — see the
  section on it further down.

The effects themselves carry **no `when`**: being in range IS the condition, and the resolution
above has already answered it by the time `applyStatMods` sees the entry (a `cond` on top still
means what it always did — Excessive Vigour's "if that unit made a Charge move this turn").

**The unit row's chip strip** holds ONE chip and a chevron: Battle-shock stays out (every unit in
the game can be in it, and it is marked every Command phase), everything else — states only some of
this unit's rules read, auras radiating from other models in the list — folds into a collapsed strip
under it, with the count on the handle. The chevron is rendered only when there is something behind
it. A Sororitas list with a Triumph put three stacked chips on every row and buried the numbers they
belong to; that is what this exists to prevent.

**An aura chip names its ability in the reader's language.** The unit half stays English by project
convention, but the ability is translated on its own card (the RU overlay), and a chip spelling it
in English would leave the reader matching two spellings of one rule. `RosterViewView` builds a
`nameEn → name` map per unit from `localizeSheet` (abilities and ability-set options alike) and only
in the RU locale — the same overlay the card fetches, so nothing new rides in the EN bundle.

**A granted CORE ability** (`stat: 'core'`, `op: 'grant'`, `on: 'unit'`) is the third kind of grant,
added 2026-08-23 because a Hospitaller's "models in that unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability" was
prose and nothing else. It is returned from `applyStatMods` like a granted keyword — never written
into the sheet — and `DatasheetCard` prints it on the **Core line** beside the printed ones, dashed
and starred, with its source in the title. **320 are stated** across 309 records: 218 to the card the
record was found on, 46 to a LED unit, 31 to the unit a Leader is attached to, 22 auras and 3 to the
Character leading a bodyguard unit.

**The layer is NOT only numeric, and calling it that cost 106 records.** This file and the
generator both described Tier C as "what a rule does to a statline", so the review pass answered
"does granting an ability count?" differently from record to record: Chameleonic got its Stealth
and Stealth Optimisation, four lines away in the same faction, was closed as `reviewed: true,
effects: []`. Both readings are defensible from that description, which is why the fix is a gate and
not a sentence — `npm run coregrants` (`scripts/check-core-grants.mjs`) reads every source's prose
for the twelve grantable core abilities and fails when the record carries no `stat: 'core'` for one.
The 2026-09-15 pass it opened closed 106 records; the remaining 39 are in its ALLOW table, each with
the reason, and they fall into five shapes worth knowing before writing a record:

- **a unit picked off the roster** ("select up to three KABALITE WARRIORS units … those units gain
  the Infiltrators ability") — a record reaches the card it is printed on, the unit its bearer
  leads, or a unit inside an aura it carries. None of those names a unit chosen in a deployment
  step, and this is the largest group (12 records);
- **the DEDICATED TRANSPORT the bearer starts inside** — there is no target for it, and the bearer
  gains nothing itself;
- **a sibling CHARACTER in the same unit** ("other CHARACTER models attached to that unit") —
  `leader` names the one Character leading a unit, not a second one standing beside the first;
- **the ability as a PRECONDITION** ("if your unit has the Deep Strike ability, it can be placed
  into Strategic Reserves") or **taken away** (the Vindicare's Dead-shot) — the layer grants, and
  grants only;
- **an army-wide rule whose body yields no scope** — Chaos Daemons' First Prince of Chaos splits
  five ways by god and `ruleScopes` reads nothing off it, so an effect would land on every unit in
  the list. Reaching nobody is the honest answer; reaching everybody is not.

**The qualifier rides in the value, behind the name.** 94 of these grants bite only against certain
attacks, and a bare `Feel No Pain 4+` on the Core line would be a plain error — so the value reads
`Feel No Pain 4+ (vs mortal wounds)`. KeywordPopover resolves a core ability by matching the
rulebook name against the START of the text, which is why the qualifier may never lead; `index.test.js`
pins both halves of that (starts with a real core ability, and never spells it " against ").

**A review pass has to look at the reviewed EMPTIES too.** The first sweep only read records
awaiting review, and the Triumph's Icon of the Valorous Heart had been closed as an empty an hour
earlier — by the ability-set pass, before a core grant was expressible at all. Three grants were
invisible for that reason. Whenever a NEW kind of effect becomes expressible, re-read the empties:
they are the records that were told "we cannot say this", and that is exactly what changed.

**And a template is not a policy.** That first sweep stated 57 of these and this file recorded the
rest as "partial in a way the layer cannot say". The 2026-08-23 audit of all 5011 sources found the
opposite: 261 grants sat in reviewed empties, and 97 of them were the plainest possible form — the
templates simply did not know "Models in the bearer's unit have…" or "Friendly SAGITAUR units have
Scouts 6"". Detachment rules were blamed on structured bodies here; their bodies are flat sentences
and the shape of the template was the whole obstacle. When a pass closes an order of magnitude fewer
records than the corpus suggests, doubt the reader before the corpus.

**`improve` is only for the roll-shaped characteristics** (`sv`/`bs`/`ws`/`ld`/`inv`, where a lower
number is better). `applyValue` REFUSES it anywhere else and returns null, so an effect written
`{stat:'ap', op:'improve'}` reads as reviewed and silently does nothing — six AP modifiers were
dead that way until 2026-08-23, the Triumph's Petals of the Bloody Rose among them. For AP the
reviewer writes `add: -1`, for Attacks `add: 1`. `index.test.js` now fails on any other pairing.

**Core rules** (`coreRules.js`, hand-written, outside the faction glob) are the smallest: Battle-shock
turning a unit's OC into `-`. It is the one core rule that rewrites a printed characteristic, it
applies to every unit of every faction, and `unit-battle-shocked` was already in the vocabulary —
which is why the switch now shows on every unit's row.

Battle-shock's *other* effect on this layer is that a Battle-shocked unit may not be affected by a
Stratagem at all, and that is enforced from both sides — the condition carries `blocksStratagems`
in `conditions.js` so the rule is stated once rather than as an id spelled out in the code:

- ahead of the fact, `stratagemsFor()` marks the ones it has not got `blocked`, so they cannot be tapped;
- after it, switching Battle-shock ON un-spends what the unit was already running
  (`stratagemsClearedBy()` → the view's `toggleUnitCondFor`). Leaving a spent stratagem rewriting
  the card of a unit that may not be affected by one is a contradiction the player would otherwise
  have to spot and undo by hand.

A unit state is written to EVERY card of an attached unit (`attachedEntries` → `toggleUnitCondFor`).
Core Rules 19.01 makes a Leader and the unit it joined one unit, and the states this vocabulary holds
are the unit's: one Battle-shock test is taken by the unit, one Charge move is made by all of it, and
one Pain token Empowers the whole of it ("while an Attached unit is Empowered, the Pain abilities of
all Leader and Bodyguard units in that unit take effect"). Before 2026-08-25 each entry kept its own
switch, so a player Empowering a Succubus-led Wych squad had to flip two chips and could leave the
two halves of one unit disagreeing. Auras are deliberately NOT mirrored: `aurasReaching` already
answers the attachment from the list (22.01), so a partner's chip list would not even hold the mark.

A battle-long stratagem is deliberately left alone: its effect (Daemonic Possession's DAEMON) was
resolved when it was spent and nothing takes it back, while a phase- or turn-long one is still
affecting the unit. Both handlers — the row's chips and the card's — go through `toggleUnitCondFor`
for exactly this reason: two switches for one fact must do the same thing.

Three things are specific to the ABILITY source:

- **It can address another unit.** "If this unit is attached to a unit … add 1 to the Strength
  characteristic of melee weapons equipped by Bodyguard models in that unit" is printed on Fabius
  Bile's card and rewrites the card of whoever he joined. An effect therefore carries `target`:
  absent (self), `unit`, `led`, or `leader` (the Character leading THIS unit — the direction exists
  and is tested, but no record needs it yet: every ability pointing that way modifies a Wound roll
  or grants Feel No Pain, neither of which is a statline).
  `datasheetEntriesFor()` resolves every cross direction from the attachment the roster records; the
  ordinary resolver skips `ref.kind === 'ability'` entirely.
- **`unit` vs `led` is Core Rules 19.04, and getting it wrong loses the leader his own buff.**
  19.04: "abilities/rules that affect a unit (or models in it) apply to EVERY model in an attached
  unit". So the ordinary Leader wording — "while this model is leading a unit, models in that unit
  have [SUSTAINED HITS 1]" — reaches the leader too, and is `unit`: it lands on the led unit's card
  and on the leader's own **while he is leading somebody**, which the roster answers. `led` is the
  narrow case GW writes deliberately, "**Bodyguard** models in that unit" — one record in the game
  (Fabius Bile's Enhanced Warriors). Until 2026-08-25 all 105 of them were written `led`, so a
  Succubus's own blades never got the ability her Storm of Blades hands the Wyches she is standing
  in; the sweep is `target` alone, and the prose ("leading" vs "Bodyguard models") decides it.
  A rule that says "this model's unit" with no leading clause is a third shape: it applies with
  nobody attached, so it stays two effects — an unconditional `self` and a `led` (Astorath's Mass of
  Doom, Lelith's Brides of Death — 12 records).
- **No keyword gate.** An ability is printed on the card it addresses, so `SCOPELESS` includes it
  alongside enhancements, allegiance abilities and wargear — there is no prose naming who it bears on.
- **`sid` is not a bare uuid here.** 56 abilities are published once and printed on several
  datasheets (Custodes' Turbo-boost is on both jetbike units), and each needs a record with its own
  `ref.unit`, so the sid is `<uuid>:<datasheet-slug>`.

Three things hold this together and are easy to break:

- **One record per army rule, deduped by NAME in the generator.** appdata publishes an army rule
  once per publication it appears in, and a Combat Patrol box reprints the codex's rule — so the
  same rule arrives 2+ times under different uuids. Every copy resolves to the same single
  `facEn.armyRule`, so the effects were applied once per copy: doubled footnotes, and a doubled
  NUMBER wherever the condition is proven — Adeptus Mechanicus' Doctrina Imperatives is answered
  automatically from the tracker, so its +1 BS was silently +2 in any game with an Imperative
  running (found 2026-08-22, 16 factions affected). The reprints are not byte-identical, hence
  name-keyed rather than prose-keyed; the smallest uuid wins so the pick is stable.
- **A record is tied to its prose by a hash** (`hash`, sha1 of the normalised English text) and to
  its rule by an appdata uuid (`sid`) plus a wh11ed-side pointer (`ref`, resolved through
  `sourceIds.json`). Matching by id, not by name, so a GW rename moves the record with the rule.
  `npm run modifiers:check` (also part of `npm run sync`) reports `stale` the moment the wording
  moves under a reviewed record — that is the only warning that a hand-read effect may now be
  wrong. Never hand-edit `hash`.
- **Scope is not stored.** Which units a rule bears on comes from `ruleTargets.js`; an effect only
  names a `scope` INDEX into `ruleScopes()` so it binds to one statement of a multi-part rule.
  A second copy of the scope in the data would be free to drift from the prose.
- **Only `reviewed` records with effects are ever applied** (`usableEntries`). An unreviewed
  skeleton means "somebody still has to read this rule", not "no effect".
- **What the gate rejects is not unreviewed — it is INVISIBLE.** `isCandidate` decides whether a
  rule gets a skeleton at all, so a wording it does not know reaches no queue and no reader. The
  2026-08-23 audit ran every one of the 5011 sources the generator sees against a looser probe and
  found 103 real modifiers behind five holes, all now patched: `improve THAT unit's` (the article
  an aura naturally uses — two +1 Ld auras had no record for that one word), a bracketed weapon
  ability granted with any subject other than "attacks/weapons" (66 sources), a characteristic set
  as "its Objective Control characteristic **is** 0" (Blood Angels' Black Rage, on six datasheets),
  a multiplied one ("double the Objective Control characteristic"), and "change the Attacks
  characteristic … to 3D6". Keep the gate loose: a false positive costs one line in the queue, a
  false negative costs a rule nobody will ever see again. `generator.test.js` pins all five.
  A SIXTH was patched on 2026-08-25, found while auditing Drukhari: a choice of weapon abilities
  written inline — "select one of the following abilities: [SUSTAINED HITS 1]; [LETHAL HITS] …
  weapons equipped by models in that unit have **that selected ability**". The bracketed names are
  in the picking sentence and the grant sentence says only "that ability", so neither grant pattern
  saw it. Ten rules were invisible behind it, Chaos Space Marines' whole ARMY RULE (Dark Pacts)
  among them. The pattern excludes "…of the abilities **in the** <X> section", which is an ability
  SET: appdata carries those options as subAbilities and each is already a source of its own.
- **`bodyText()` must keep every text field of a block, not the first.** A `triggerEffectAccordion`
  holds the condition in `trigger` and the RULE in `effect`, and `text || trigger || effect` kept
  the trigger and threw the rule away — Aeldari's Battle Focus manoeuvres ("add 2" to the Move
  characteristic") reached neither this generator nor the two text-drift guards that share the
  helper (`sync-faction-text`, `appdata-text-diff`), which were comparing our full prose against
  half of appdata's. Fixed 2026-08-23; the drift count over all 30 factions is unchanged at 239,
  so nothing was papering over a real difference.
- **`grantedKeywordsFrom` runs before the apply pass, in BOTH readers.** A granted keyword decides
  which rules bear on the unit at all (Necrons' Destroyer Ankh gives its bearer DESTROYER CULT, and
  only then does Cold Fervour reach it), so gating on the un-granted set answers a different
  question. `RosterUnitRulesModal` always did this; `RosterViewView`'s own compact stat plates
  didn't, which let a plate and the card behind it disagree — the one thing the two sharing
  `rosterStatMods.js` exists to prevent. No current record makes them differ (8 unconditional
  keyword grants, none gating a profile stat), so this is a latent case kept closed, not a repair.
  That view resolves the CONTEXT once per entry (`ctxByUid`) and the applied sheet once per entry
  (`statModCache`), rather than re-running either for each of the four readers that walk the list —
  the plates, the army-wide switch strip, the per-unit chips and the unit modal.

The layer is detachable: delete `src/data/rosterModifiers/` and `loadRosterModifiers` resolves to
null, the card keeps its printed numbers, and Tiers A+B are unaffected. Nothing is written into
the hand-authored faction files.

#### Authoring a record

The generator writes the skeleton; `effects`, `when`, `cond` and `reviewed` are the human's and
survive regeneration. The shape, fixed since the layer was built:

```js
{ scope: 0, on: 'melee', stat: 's', op: 'add', value: 2,
  only: { tag: 'PSYCHIC' }, alt: 1,
  when: { en: '…', ru: '…' }, cond: ['unit-charged'] }
```

- `on` — `profile` | `ranged` | `melee` | `weapon` (both weapon tables) | `unit` (keyword grants)
- `stat` — datasheet keys `m/t/sv/w/ld/oc/inv`, weapon `a/bs/ws/s/ap/d/range`, plus `ability` and
  `keyword` for grants (`op: 'grant'`, `value` the name — `SUSTAINED HITS 1`, unbracketed)
- `op` — `add` | `set` | `improve` | `grant`. `improve` is only for roll-shaped characteristics
  (saves, Ld, BS/WS), where better means lower. For a plain number the reviewer writes `add` with
  the sign the rule implies: AP is printed negative, so "+1 AP" is `add: -1`.
- **`stat: 'ability'` also takes `add`** — the number inside an ability the weapon ALREADY prints:
  "…or, if that attack already has [RAPID FIRE], +1 to the value of that [RAPID FIRE]". The value
  then carries the name AND the amount (`'RAPID FIRE 1'` = +1 to RAPID FIRE), matching the shape of
  the grant it is paired with. An ability that prints no number of its own is left alone rather
  than guessed at. One rule in the whole dataset needs this (Orks' *Dead Shiny Shootas*) — the
  wording was searched for across all 30 factions before the op was added.
- **An ability-set option's condition sits with its PICK, not with the ability.** Pulse Jet
  (Wazdakka) is the one record in the dataset gated both ways — the option has to be the one
  selected this round AND the unit has to have Advanced — and the second half used to live only
  inside the accordion the ability is read in, several taps down from the chip that selects it.
  `RosterUnitRulesModal`'s `pickCondSwitches` lifts the conditions of the PICKED option into the
  picks block, and `abilitySwitches` skips `ref.set` records so the card never shows one chip
  twice. Auto-applying the modifier on the pick alone was considered and rejected: the engine is
  chosen in the Command phase for the whole turn, the unit may then move normally, and Pulse Jet
  REPLACES the Advance roll rather than adding to it — so the +6" would be wrong on any turn the
  unit did not Advance.
- **`only` is judged against the row as THIS record found it**, not against the running sheet: the
  two clauses of one rule describe the printed profile, not each other's output. Authored as a
  pair with inverse gates (`only: {notTag:'RAPID FIRE'}` for the grant, `only: {tag:'RAPID FIRE'}`
  for the bump), so every row takes exactly one. Without that snapshot the grant added the tag and
  the bump then found it, and every weapon took both halves of an either/or.
- `when: null` means unconditional — and unconditional is the only thing that rewrites a number
  without proof. Anything else needs both a bilingual `when` and a `cond`.
- A rule whose reading is "changes no printed number" is kept with `effects: []` and
  `reviewed: true` — otherwise the generator proposes it again forever.

Run `npm run modifiers` to refresh skeletons, `npm run modifiers:queue` to write the working list
(`MODIFIER-QUEUE.local.json`, gitignored), `npm run modifiers:check` to fail on anything unreviewed
or stale. The check is part of `npm run sync` — see `DATA-SYNC.md`.

**A lesson worth not relearning** (2026-08-22): the candidate heuristic tests the prose for things
like `+1 OC` or `+2" M`, and `bodyText()` hands it appdata's emphasis intact (`+2" **M**`). Two
asterisks between the number and the letter hid **141 rules** from the scan — a Custodes detachment
that plainly says +2" M had no record at all. `isCandidate` strips `**` before testing now; if a
rule that obviously changes a number is missing, suspect the markup before the pipeline.

## A roster attached to a game (`rosterGameLink.js`)

A tracker game can carry each player's army list. **Optional on both sides** — a game with no
lists is the normal case and nothing in the tracker may require one. Attaching happens in the setup
wizard — the roster field in step 1 (`RosterPickerModal.vue`), or automatically when the game was
started from a roster via `rosterHandoff.js` — **and, since 2026-08-22, mid-game** from
`EditSetupModal.vue`, with the same picker restricted to the faction already in play (a game that
started without a list used to be a dead end). What the two attachments are allowed to decide
differs; see `src/components/tracker/CLAUDE.md`.

**A snapshot, not a reference.** `player.roster` holds the list itself; `player.rosterId` is
provenance only and may dangle. A game outlives the roster it was played with — the list gets
edited between games, deleted, or never existed locally at all (an opponent's arrives as a share
link and is deliberately NOT saved to the collection). A finished game in history, or one restored
from the cloud on another device, still has to show the army that was fielded.

- **Same shape as a share link.** `rosterSnapshot()` is `rosterShare.js`'s `rosterPayload()` — one
  definition of "a roster in transit", so a snapshot and a link migrate identically.
- **Migrated on READ** (`rosterFromPlayer`), not on write: wargear/size picks are indices into
  generated data the generator renumbers, and a game is kept for months. Same treatment
  `importRoster` gives a share payload.
- **Size.** `wh11ed-api` caps a synced game at 64 KB (`config.maxGameBytes`) and both players share
  that budget with the game itself, so the snapshot stays in the stored ids-and-indices form —
  never resolved names or datasheets. `rosterGameLink.test.js` pins it (~150 bytes per entry).
- **The list decides the army.** Picking a roster in the wizard sets that player's faction, and
  `resolveArmyChoice()` takes the detachments from it; switching faction afterwards DETACHES it,
  because a list describes one army and would otherwise sit there labelling the wrong one.

**Viewing it in game:** `/tracker/game/roster/:pi` renders `RosterViewView` — the same screen as
`/roster/:id/view`, fed from the game's snapshot instead of the store (back link to the game, no
edit pencil). Deliberately not a second copy of the screen: this is where the live-rules layer
(active Waaagh! etc.) will hang. `useTracker.js` is **dynamically imported** there — it statically
pulls the mission/event datasets (~280 KB of source) and the ordinary roster route must not carry
them. Entry point: the chip under each player's detachments in `RoundTracker.vue`.

### What a printed ability is doing (`src/composables/abilityStatus.js`)

Tier C reads faction RULES; a datasheet's own abilities are in no dataset at all, so on a card they
are prose and nothing else — no statement of whether they are doing anything. Most of them could not
have one (per attack, per target, on a dice roll) and guessing would be worse than silence. **One
family can be answered honestly, and it is a big one:** ~110 abilities open with "While this model is
leading a unit…", 8 with the mirror image ("while a CHARACTER model is leading this unit"), and
whether a model is leading or is being led is a fact the LIST records.

So the card states that fact — "ведёт отряд Intercessor Squad" beside the ability, or "не присоединён
— не действует", with the whole row dimmed. Two deliberate limits:

- **The badge names the PRECONDITION, not the conclusion.** Several of these abilities carry a
  second condition in the same sentence ("…leading a unit that is below its Starting Strength"), so
  "leading X" is a fact we know and "not attached" is a conclusion we can draw; "in effect" is not.
- **Read from the ENGLISH prose**, like `ruleTargets.js` — the RU overlay translates the sentence,
  and a translated sentence is not something to pattern-match. The map is keyed by English ability
  name, which is what `nameEn` carries once the overlay has renamed the header.
- Only with roster context. On a datasheet being READ there is no attachment to report, and an
  unconditional "not attached" would be a statement about nothing.

**The English name is kept.** `localizeSheet` records `nameEn` whenever it renames a header, and
`DatasheetCard` shows it small, in brackets. Everything AROUND an ability on screen — detachment
rules, enhancements, stratagems, the augmentation chips — stays English by project convention, so a
translated header with no original was the one name on the card that could not be matched to the
codex or said out loud to an opponent.

**Every note says where it came from.** The footnotes under the stats are grouped by source and each
group is headed by it — `Army rule`, `Detachment · Creations of Bile`, `Enhancement`, `Leader ·
Fabius Bile`, `Ability`, `Wargear`, `Stratagem · War Horde`, `Core rule`, `Mark`. Text only, no colour of its own: the card already carries the
faction accent and five source colours would fight it. Three of the six labels are the block below's
own words, reused rather than reworded, so the same rule reads the same whether the reader meets it
as a footnote or as a block. Ability records carry `owner` and `from` (self / led / leader) for
exactly this — the record's stored name is `"<unit>: <ability>"` and the two halves have to travel
apart.

**Two lists, and which one a note is in.** `applyStatMods` stamps every note with **`live`** — is
this modifier in force right now? — and the card renders the two apart (`noteSections`):

- **«Modifiers in play»** (`dsModifiers`) — the live ones. `live` is NOT `applied`: a modifier in
  force that had nothing computable to change (no melee row to add to, a dice value) is live with
  `applied: false` and belongs here, because it IS in play.
- **«Possible modifiers»** (`dsModifiersPossible`) — an accordion, closed, everything waiting on a
  condition **except the core rules** (`possibleModNotes`): a core rule applies to every unit of
  every army in every game, so against one roster it says nothing — Battle-shock's OC would be a
  line on every unit of every list being planned, and in this app that rule mostly decides whether
  the unit can be targeted with a stratagem at all, which is a table question, not a list one.
  **Only off the table.** In a game the caller passes `hidePossible` and they are not
  rendered at all: a block headed "in play" must not list what is not, and mid-battle a list of what
  MIGHT be true is one more thing to scroll past. Nothing is lost — the condition and its switch are
  on the rule block below the card, which is where it is flipped. **A line inside it says what the
  list is** (`dsModifiersPossibleHint`, 2026-08-27): the heading alone reads as a second helping of
  «modifiers in play» above it, with no way to tell that none of it is running or that it comes from
  rules printed elsewhere on the card — the army rule, a detachment, an attached Leader. It sits
  INSIDE the accordion, so it costs nothing until the reader has already asked for the list.
  **Its handle is a dashed pill**
  (`.ds-mods-btn`), the same one the roster-wide block below uses: closed, the accordion is the last
  thing before the abilities, and its separator lives on the list INSIDE it — so a bare caps line
  sat on top of "Core: Leader, Deep Strike" and read as that block's heading. Quiet (muted, accent
  on hover) on purpose: «in play» above it keeps the accent, and what is merely possible must not
  shout louder than what is true.
- Above the unit list, out of a game, the same idea at roster scale: **`RosterViewView`'s
  `possibleGroups`** collects the not-live notes of the roster-wide sources only (army rule,
  detachment rule) from the cards' own notes, deduped per rule, and shows them in the
  place the switch strip takes during a game. An ability, a wargear rule or an enhancement belongs
  to the one unit that carries it and stays on that unit's card.
- Of the 1429 hand-authored effects, **502 carry a sentinel** (`never`/`blocked-subset`/
  `blocked-weapon`) and so can never be live. Off the table they read as "possible", which is a
  slight stretch — they are really "yours to apply by hand" — but a third list for them would cost
  more than it explains.

**Off the table the ROSTER still answers for itself.** `rosterConditions(entry)` (rosterGameContext)
answers the `scope: 'roster'` conditions with no game anywhere — today only `unit-leading`, which
proves the 18 enhancement effects worded "while the bearer is leading a unit". Both the card
(`RosterUnitRulesModal`'s `activeConds`) and the row (`RosterViewView`'s `activeFor`) use it, so
they agree. Deliberately NOT `activeConditions` with an empty player: that also answers the
clock-scoped ids, and a null clock reads as round 1 — "during battle rounds 1-3" would switch itself
on in a list nobody is playing yet.

**A modifier note opens its own rule.** A note the caller could resolve to prose carries
`hasSource`, and then the rule's name in the footnote under the stats opens it in the same popover a
core ability uses (`mod-source-click` → `RosterUnitRulesModal`'s `modSource`). Before that, seeing
"+2\" M · Experimental Augmentations" meant going to find that rule in another block of the same
card.

### Live rules — what is true right now

Tier C rewrites a printed number only when the modifier is unconditional. Opened from a game, it
can also rewrite one whose condition the game PROVES — which is the reason to open a list mid-battle
at all. Three files, one idea:

- **`src/data/rosterModifiers/conditions.js`** — the vocabulary. Every conditional effect carries
  `cond`, a list of condition ids that must all hold, hand-assigned in the same review pass that
  wrote `effects` (161 distinct `when` wordings; there is no grammar to parse, but the STATES a game
  can be in are enumerable). Each id declares its `scope` — who answers it — and its `duration`.
  **125 of the pre-2026-08-22 275 conditional effects are answerable**; the rest carry a **sentinel** (`never`,
  `blocked-subset`, `blocked-weapon`) that says why not. **A missing `cond` is not "unconditional" —
  it is unreviewed, and is treated as unproven.**

  Two of the original four blockers were removed by giving the effect somewhere to put the
  restriction instead of the prose, and both are worth knowing before authoring a record:
  - **`only`** — a target narrower than `on` can express. `{ tag }` / `{ notTag }` match the
    weapon's printed ability (PSYCHIC, TORRENT, PISTOL, RAPID FIRE — which is exactly what those
    phrases name), `{ name }` matches the weapon by name, `{ notName: [...] }` excludes several by
    name; all prefix-matched, since a tag carries its value ("RAPID FIRE 1") and a name can be
    qualified ("Plague Wind – overcharge"). `notName` is a LIST because the wording that needs it is
    one — "weapons equipped by models in this unit (excluding blast pistols, blasters and dark
    lances)", the Hand of the Archon's Assassins' Poisons, which without it granted LETHAL HITS and
    PRECISION to the three weapons the rule names to leave out. What is left blocked needs a choice
    the data doesn't record — "one melee weapon, selected at the start of the battle".
  - **`alt`** — the index, within the same record, of the effect this one REPLACES. While an
    alternate is in force its base is skipped entirely, so "+1, or +2 instead" can never become
    +3. An alternate must be conditional (an unconditional one would suppress its base forever)
    and, where its prose names several characteristics, the record carries one alternate per
    characteristic. Pinned by `index.test.js`.
  - A subset naming part of the unit ("Penitent models, while…") still belongs in `scope`, the
    index of the rule statement that says it — 10 were moved there; 26 remain where the rule's own
    prose has no statement matching the subset.
  **`group` makes ids alternatives**: only so many of a group can be on, enforced on WRITE in
  `useTracker` (`enforceGroupLimit`) rather than in a view, so no caller can forget. The rules say
  it in words — "select one of the Orders below", and for Orders even how it resolves ("any Order
  subsequently issued to that unit replaces the current one"). **`GROUP_LIMITS`** carries the size
  of a group that holds more than one: Creations of Bile's six augmentations pick TWO ("either
  select one from the list below, or randomly determine two"), and without the cap all six could be
  switched on at once, each rewriting a stat — a Fabius Bile read 8"/T5 against a printed 6"/T4.
  A full group EVICTS its oldest member rather than refusing the tap, so it stays changeable in one
  gesture the way a single-slot group is; ties on the stamp break on insertion order.
  `activeConditions` applies the same cap on READ, because a game saved before the cap existed can
  still hold six. Ungrouped where the rule allows any number: Blessings of Khorne activates up to
  two, Combat Drugs can be rolled two at a time.
  Datasheet abilities added five ids of their own: `unit-stationary` ("each time this unit Remains
  Stationary…"), `unit-engaged`, `unit-empowered` (Drukhari spend a Pain token to Empower a unit;
  the tracker banks the tokens but does not record which unit was Empowered), and the three
  `protocol-*` ids a Cybernetica Datasmith puts its KASTELAN ROBOTS into — one group, battle-long,
  since a protocol "remains until it enters a different one".
  **A "select one of N" rule is a switch, not a sentinel** — Martial Ka'tah's stances, Grey Knights'
  Channelled Force, Hagiomnifex's five abilities are things only the player knows, which is exactly
  what a switch is for. Marking one `never` (as the first review pass did) leaves the card showing a
  note it could have applied.
- **`src/composables/rosterGameContext.js`** — the answers. Each id is answered from exactly ONE
  source: `auto` (the tracker already knows — a called Waaagh! from the Ork toggle spec, the active
  Doctrina Imperative from the Adeptus Mechanicus selection spec), `roster` (the list already says
  so — a Leader's attachment), or a switch the player flips. **Every auto reader checks the faction
  first**: the specs are built from shared primitives, so `army.toggleRounds` means "Waaagh!" only
  for Orks. Most trackers record something other than what the conditions ask about (Drukhari count
  Pain tokens, not the active Combat Drug), so those stay switches. An auto condition is deliberately NOT hand-flippable: two sources for
  one fact is how this card and the tracker card next to it start disagreeing.
- **`rosterStatMods.js`** takes the resulting set as `active`. A proven effect is applied AND keeps
  its condition text, with `via` naming what proved it — `DatasheetCard` renders that third state
  (`ds-mod-live`) distinctly from both a printed value and an unmet condition.

**The clock.** A switch stores WHEN it was flipped as one monotonic stamp — `round*100 + turn*10 +
phase` — so every duration is a single comparison: `phase` wants the same stamp, `turn` the same
round and turn, `round` the same round, `battle` anything. That matters because five conditions
last a phase by their own rules and four last a turn; with the round as the only boundary they
stayed true through phases they had no business being true in.

Two things degrade it, both deliberately: a game not keeping phases (`settings.trackPhases`, off by
default — and since 2026-08-25 offered in EVERY game, not only one with a list, because the
tracker's phase reminder reads the clock too) records round-only stamps, and a game saved before stamps existed holds a bare round
number — which can never be mistaken for a stamp, since the smallest real one is 100. Either way
every duration falls back to the round boundary, which is what this layer did before the clock
existed. Clearing EARLY is the safe direction: a stale switch would silently rewrite a number.

**`scope: 'clock'` conditions are answered by the tracker, never by a switch** — same one-source
law as `auto`. Two kinds: a `phase` id names the phase and whose turn it must be (`side: 'own'` for
"your Shooting phase", `'any'` for the Fight phase, which happens in both), and only a game keeping
phases can answer one; a `rounds` id names a battle-round window (Mont'ka's 1-3, Kauyon's 3-5) and
answers in EVERY game, because the round is always known. `clockOf(game, pi)` builds what the
answers are read from, `stampOf(clock)` is what a switch stores.

**Where the switches are** (settled 2026-08-22 — a state is flipped where the thing it changes is
READ, never in a strip that says nothing about which rule it feeds):

- **Above the unit list** — army-wide states. Facts about the battle, not about one unit.
- **On the unit's row in the list**, under its stats (`.rvunit-conds`) — that unit's own states.
  These are what a player flips every turn (charged, advanced, remained stationary), and opening a
  card for that is a step too many. The row had to stop being one big `<button>` to hold them.
- **On the ability**, inside the card (`DatasheetCard`'s `abilitySwitches`) — the states that
  ability's own modifier records name. Only `self` records: an ability printed on a Leader's card is
  not in this sheet's list, and its condition belongs to the unit it addresses.
- **Inside the rule**, in the "In effect for this unit" block, army-wide ones included
  (`gameCtx.armySwitches`) — the place a player MEETS Creations of Bile's augmentations is the
  detachment rule on a unit's card.
- **At the top of the card** (`gameCtx.switches`) — restored 2026-08-25, having been removed in
  the settling above. The rule it was removed for ("never in a strip that says nothing about which
  rule it feeds") stopped applying when a set of chips gained the rule that named it: "BATTLEFIELD
  BUTCHERY · Empowered" is not an anonymous strip. And the number it changes is on THIS card —
  before, flipping Empowered meant the accordion on the unit's row and reading what it did meant
  opening the card afterwards. The chips inside the abilities and rules below stay: they sit in
  collapsed bodies, and it is one store either way.

**What cannot be spent right now is folded away, not greyed** (2026-08-25). The stratagem block on
a unit's card shows what can be used and puts the rest behind a one-tap count. In a phase where two
of nine are usable, seven inert chips are what the reader scans past to find them; the reason each
one is blocked is still there, one tap down, because "where did my stratagem go" is a worse
question than "why is this one grey". Safe because `stratagemsFor` only asks whether a stratagem is
blocked once it is OFF — `on` and `blocked` are never both true, so the fold can never swallow one
that is actually running.

**A set of chips says whose rule it is** (2026-08-25). Six chips reading "Adrenalight", "Hypex",
"Serpentin"… are unreadable: finding out that they are **Combat Drugs**, off the Spectacle of Spite
detachment, meant opening units one at a time and expanding their abilities. `switchesFor` now
returns `src` — the first record that named each condition (`kind`/`name`/`det`/`unit`) — and
`RosterViewView.srcInfo` turns that into the owner's name and the rule's body, which the pure layer
could not do because it has no faction data. 24 of the 27 army-scope conditions are named by a
detachment rule or an army rule, two by an enhancement, one by a datasheet ability; that last case
still gets its rule NAMED, which is most of the answer, and the text stays on that unit's card.

`ConditionChips` boxes a group that has an owner, not only one that is `capped` (the class is now
`boxed`), and buckets ungrouped chips by `groupOwner` — without that second key two rules' chips
would share one bucket and one heading, which would be a heading that lies about half of them.

**`groupInfo` is a different field from `info`, and the difference is load-bearing.** A set
explained by ONE rule puts that rule's "i" on the heading; a set whose options each have their own
(the Triumph's six relics, one aura each) keeps an "i" per chip. Both are "a set with an owner", so
the owner cannot be what decides it — the caller says which kind it has.

**Every chip that raises a question answers it — through the "i" beside it** (2026-08-23).
`ConditionChips` has always drawn that button for a switch carrying `info: { name, text }`, which
until now only an ability-set pick and an aura had. Two more kinds now do:

- **A stratagem chip opens the stratagem itself.** `RosterUnitRulesModal.stratSource()` finds the
  card the way `modSource` finds a detachment rule — by the detachment the record names, then by
  `enhKey` inside it — and `stratText()` writes it out as bold-labelled `WHEN / TARGET / EFFECT /
  RESTRICTIONS` lines, prefixed by the CP. **Not** StratCard's layout: `renderRichText` knows
  nothing of its `◈ LABEL |` info-cards, and reproducing them here would be a second renderer to
  keep in step. The flavour text is dropped — the one field that says nothing about the rule. The
  faction bundle it reads is the localised one, so the popover reads in the modal's own locale, and
  the RU name rides in the popover header (`openRule`'s new `sub` argument, drawn as `.kw-name-ru`)
  the way it rides under the chip. This is also the real answer to "why won't this chip press?" —
  the WHEN line names the phase the chip is refusing you in.
- **A game-state chip opens the core rule that defines it** — `conditions.js`'s new `hint`
  field, written in both locales (`RosterViewView.withRuleInfo` picks one) and free to use the same
  body markup as any rule text, so `(01.07)` navigates and `[gloss:battle-shocked:…]` opens its
  definition. Nine states have one: charged, advanced, remained stationary, engaged, Battle-shocked
  and not, arrived from Reserves, disembarked, at starting strength. A state that is some FACTION's
  rule (an Imperative, an Order, a Kastelan protocol) deliberately has none — its text lives in that
  rule's own body, a pointer this dictionary does not hold, and a hand-written paraphrase of
  somebody else's rule is how the two quietly come to disagree. Reaching those needs the id →
  rule + `### ` subheading map the search index already builds through `extractSubheadings.js`;
  until then no `hint` means no button, which is the honest state.

`index.test.js` guards the hints: both locales present, and every `(nn.nn)` in one resolves to a
`section-…` id that still exists in `basicRules` / `advancedRules` / `battleRound` — a renumbered
section must fail here, not under a reader's finger.

**A stratagem chip carries its Russian name under the English one** (2026-08-23), the same pairing
`StratCard` renders on the card itself: the name stays English, because that is what the printed
card and the GW app both say, and the translation is a display line. It is keyed by the English name
off the faction RU module's `stratNamesRu` — which the modal now keeps alongside the overlay it
already loads, since nothing else in the chip pipeline holds that map. The same gap existed one
level up: `RosterViewView`'s Rules and Stratagems tabs render `RuleBlock`'s `subtitle` and
`StratCard`'s `nameRu`, but its loader never attached any of the RU name maps, so those lines had
never appeared — `withRuNames()` now does it there the way `useFactionPage` does it for the faction
page (army rule, detachment, detachment rule, stratagems, enhancements).

`RosterUnitRulesModal` has **no switch strip of its own** any more. All four places render
`ConditionChips.vue` (`src/components/`, not this directory — it is not roster-specific) and write
to the same store through one handler that routes on the switch's own `scope`, so no two of them can
disagree. A FINISHED game reached from the history list
(`/tracker/history/:gid/roster/:pi`) shows the same screen as a record: the recorded context still
shapes the numbers, but there are no controls. Only conditions the roster's own rules actually name are
offered, and only ones that can be answered — a switch that changes nothing on screen is worse than
no switch. State lives in the game (`player.ctx.army` / `player.ctx.units[uid]`, written by
`useTracker`'s `setArmyCondition`/`setUnitCondition`), never in the roster.

**The stratagems tab reads the clock too.** In a live game keeping phases it offers a "usable now"
filter — what this player can use in the slot the game is standing on. `phasesOf` (grouping, used
by the standalone stratagems page too) is deliberately untouched; `phaseSidesOf` is the extra half
that reads WHOSE phase the timing names, and `usableInSlot` is the predicate. A history record is
excluded: its clock stopped where the game ended.

**What the game asked this layer to keep** (2026-08-25). `game.settings` carries a master and five
family switches — the table and their help live in `src/data/trackerOptions.js`; what they do to
THIS screen is here. The master (`trackModifiers`) is answered in exactly one place, `statModsFor`
in `RosterViewView`: off, it returns the printed sheet with no marks and no notes, so the row
plates, the card behind them and the "possible" summary fall back together and nothing downstream
needs a gate of its own. The five families each gate one source:

- `trackUnitStates` / `trackArmyStates` → `activeConditions(player, clock, entry, { unit, army })`.
  The other three sources in that loop — `auto`, `clock`, `roster` — are **never** gated: they cost
  the player nothing to maintain, so there is nothing to switch off, and a called Waaagh! keeps
  rewriting the card in a game that offers no army chips at all.
- `trackStratagems` / `trackAbilitySets` → the two halves of `chosenFor`, plus `gameCtx.strats` and
  `gameCtx.picks`.
- `trackAuras` → `auraOn` inside `attachmentCtxOf`, plus the aura chip cache.

**Off the table every gate is open.** A list read in the builder has no game to carry settings, and
`keeps()` says so — the whole layer applies, as it always did.

**The degradation is one-directional and that is the point.** A family that is not consulted leaves
its effects unproven, which is exactly the state an effect is in before the battle proves it: listed
on the card with the condition it waits for. A switched-off family can make a card say LESS; it can
never make it say something false. The player's own switches are untouched in `player.ctx`, so
turning a family back on mid-game restores every one of them.

**Unconditional effects are not a sixth family.** They ask nothing of the player — they are this
list's correct numbers — so they hang off the master alone. Offering to switch them off separately
would be offering to make the card wrong.

**User decisions behind all of this** (2026-08-20/22), none derivable from the code: both players
may have a list and neither must; the roster link is an ornament, never a precondition; context
state lives in the game, not in the roster; a faction with no tracker spec still gets a plain
army-level switch; positional and per-attack conditions are never automated; wounds, casualties and
table position are out of scope — this is a reference that knows the rules in play, not a
battlefield. Phases are opt-in per game and offered only where a list is attached, since the roster
screen is the only thing that reads them.

## Printing a list (added 2026-08-27)

`/roster/:id/print` — `RosterPrintView.vue` (the panel), `RosterPrintSheet.vue` (the document and
its pagination), `RosterPrintFragment.vue` (the one template every piece of the document renders
through), `RosterPrintUnitCard.vue` (one unit: which tier of the overlay goes on paper),
`RosterPrintCard.vue` (paper's own typography of a datasheet), `src/data/rosterPrintOptions.js`
(the options table, the paper constants and `paginatePrint`), and the `@media print` block in
`style.css`.

**The screen IS the document, and the pages are REAL.** The sheet renders its whole content once,
unpaginated, in a hidden measuring flow (`.rps-measure`, laid out at paper width); every
indivisible piece — a heading, a rule, a row of the list, a pair of stratagem cards, a unit card —
is a `data-u` unit with a measured top and bottom; and `paginatePrint` deals those units onto page
BOXES of exactly the printable height of A4 (`.rps-page`, `break-after: page`). What is inside a
box on screen is what is on that sheet of paper, because there is nothing left for the browser's
print fragmentation to decide — nothing overflows a box. **Three models were tried and buried
before this one** (all on 2026-08-27, do not repeat them): pushing blocks down with margins
(invented gaps the document did not have), pushing only cards (wrong inside multi-column
sections), and drawing computed edge lines over one flow (`pageEdgesOf` — a simulation of the
print engine that could never quite agree with it; the lines cut through prose, headings and
whatever else was not declared an atom).

**Both the measuring flow and the pages render the SAME `RosterPrintFragment`** — a slice
`from..to` of one block's units — which is what makes the measurement honest: the whole block is
just the slice `0..length`. Margins on units are BOTTOM-only, so a unit that opens a page sits at
its top without eating budget the arithmetic never saw. The list table repeats `<colgroup>` +
`<thead>` per fragment (`table-layout: fixed` keeps split pieces aligned) and the sheet charges a
continuation for the header's height (`overheads`). A unit taller than a whole page gets a page of
its own flagged `spill` — its box grows and the printer runs it over two sheets; text is never
clipped to keep the boxes honest.

**`paginatePrint` is pure and tested on numbers** (`rosterPrintOptions.test.js`). `keepWithNext`
(section and phase headings — chains) is never left as the last unit of a page; `breakBefore` (the
per-card page-break option) opens a fresh page without orphaning the heading pulled forward with
it. jsdom measures every rect as 0, so component tests always see one page holding everything —
the arithmetic is covered where it lives.

**No section is set in CSS columns any more.** In a multi-column flow a unit's vertical offset
says nothing about its place in the flow, and offsets are the one thing pagination reasons about.
Columns survive only INSIDE an unbreakable unit, where nothing ever cuts through: a rule prints
full width with its body in two internal columns (`.rps-rule-body { columns: 2 }` — book measure,
balanced), and stratagems come PRE-PAIRED by the sheet (`{ t: 'pair', items: [st, st?] }`, a
little grid of two cards, the pair is the unit).

**Two presets over one list of checkboxes** (`PRINT_OPTIONS`). Compact is the pocket sheet — the
list, the rules, the stratagems one line each; Full adds the stratagem text and a card per unit.
They are not modes: touching any box keeps everything else and just stops calling itself a preset
(`presetOf` → null → "your own set"). A row with `requires` is drawn indented, greys out with its
parent and is forced off by `printOptionOn`, which is also how the sheet reads every value — the
panel and the document can never disagree about a child row.

**Modifiers are three tiers offered as two switches**, the same split the overlay already has (see
"Modifier overlay" above): nothing = the printed datasheet; `trim` = the sheet this entry actually
fields; `+ modifiers` = its numbers as the roster's rules leave them, marked and attributed. **Off
never prints a wrong number, it prints the printed one** — the reason the switch exists at all is
that a sheet handed across the table is read as a datasheet. The same rule governs granted
keywords. `RosterPrintUnitCard` decides the tier; the resolution is `useRosterUnitCard`
(`src/composables/rosterUnitCard.js`), the same composable `RosterUnitRulesModal` reads, so the
Save a player reads off paper and the one their phone shows are the same number by construction.

**`RosterPrintCard` is paper's own typography of the sheet, not a restyled `DatasheetCard`.** The
data is the same (the resolved sheet, `datasheetParts.js` for the derived parts — granted core,
keyword footnotes, faction-keyword bolding — shared with the screen card so the two cannot
disagree); the typography is the medium's: the card carries its own NAME PLATE (paper has no page
header or modal title to name the unit, and the plate also absorbs the copy's facts — Warlord,
enhancement, attached-to, points — which used to cost a line of their own); the statline keeps
the screen card's chamfered plates, in monochrome ink; the ABILITIES are set in two internal
columns (that is where a card's
height lives — full-width A4 is a 120-character line), with a group's heading glued into its first
item so a column never ends on a title; named rules, Damaged, Transport and the build choices join
the same column stream as plain entries; keywords are one small line each; and there are no fills
or washes at all — separation is rules and weight, because a printer pays for every tinted band in
toner. The "can be attached to" block is not printed: the list answered that, and the name plate
says which unit it joined. `DatasheetCard`'s print-only props (`dense`, `hideAttachment`,
`hidePoints`) went away with its print duty.

**The browser prints it.** `window.print()`, no PDF library: the document is text and tables, so
"Save as PDF" in the browser's own dialog gives selectable text, embedded fonts and Cyrillic for
free, offline, at zero bundle cost. **Open question, needs a device:** whether an installed PWA on
iOS offers printing at all; the screen still reads and the panel carries an "open in the browser"
line for that case.

**`--print-scale` is the density control** — one multiplier on the paper element; every size, gap
and line-height in the fragments is `calc(X * var(--print-scale, 1))`, and the print card's ems
all hang off one scaled base font. A hard-coded rem in a fragment silently opts that element out.
Density and data loads re-measure through a ResizeObserver on the measuring flow; a zoomed preview
(narrow screens scale the paper with `zoom`) divides rects back through `paperScale()`.

**The sheet count is the document's own answer** (`emit('pages')` after each deal), shown by the
panel — that is what makes "denser" checkable before the printer answers it.

**Paper has its own palette, and it is not the theme's.** The app's accent follows the theme, and
`[data-theme='dark'] strong` is near-white — so a reader in the dark theme printed white ability
names onto white paper. `.rps` pins the accent to an ink colour and restores the light-theme
treatment of `strong`; the page boxes are white in both themes because that is what they are. The
same `.rps` block also strips style.css's GLOBAL table dressing off every table in the document —
the global `th` is light text on a dark band (which printed white-on-white, since the paper
palette pins the band light while `--text-on-dark` stays near-white), and the row stripes, hover
tint and prose margins are screen furniture.

**The header and the list are the two sections that make it an army list**; everything else is
optional reference (`PRINT_OPTIONS`). The header (whose list, which detachments, the Force
Disposition it declared, how many points, which data version, the date) always prints. The list's wargear column disappears when the unit
cards are on, because every loadout is then on a card a few pages later. (Organisers collect lists
as files, in advance: nobody hands paper to anyone at the door, so do not write copy that says
they do.)

**Not in `STATIC_ROUTES` and not in the sitemap** — a private route like `/tracker/game`;
`gen-seo-routes.mjs` must not learn about it.

## Known gaps

The builder's transient tracking docs are gone — this file is the stable reference, and the
work-in-progress journals they held were retired once their phases closed (they survive in the git
history). Cloud backup used to head the open-questions list; it was built on 2026-08-22 (see
"Cloud sync" above) and has been deployed and verified in production since 2026-08-26.

One modelling gap, now CONTAINED rather than open: appdata gives a faction several army rules, our
faction files one (sometimes a merge, `Synapse & Shadow in the Warp`). A record for a rule we do not
model separately used to resolve through `ref: {kind:'armyRule'}` anyway and read the wrong body for
its scopes — T'au's `Drones` reading `For the Greater Good`. `resolveModifierEntries` now requires
the names to answer to each other (containment either way, apostrophes and case aside), so such a
record is dropped instead of mis-resolved. The gap itself remains: `Drones` has no home until the
faction files model more than one army rule.

**What the audit of 2026-08-22 found is NOT a source, and why** (so nobody re-checks): `ability:
core` (1308 — rulebook abilities the app already carries), `wargearRules` (1371 — build
instructions, not effects), `ability: faction` (1145 — an empty pointer at the army rule, though it
is the key to modelling several of those), `damageAbility` (243 — almost all "-1 to the Hit roll",
and the tracker deliberately does not count wounds), mission twists and core stratagems (one
candidate each). What the layer STILL cannot express, whatever the source: modifiers on an INCOMING
attack ("-1 to the Damage of that attack" — 15 records, the largest single family of reviewed
empties), debuffs on an ENEMY unit, and an op for a MULTIPLIED characteristic ("double the Objective
Control", "triple the Attacks") — those last are proposed and closed as empties on purpose, so the
rule is on the record rather than invisible.

**An AURA hangs off an ability, a piece of wargear or an ENHANCEMENT.** The first two find their
radiating entry through `ref.unit` — the datasheet the rule is printed on. An enhancement has no
`ref.unit`: which model wears the relic is the roster's answer, so it is resolved by NAME instead
(added 2026-08-23, for the eight relics that buff the units around their bearer):

- the generator gives an enhancement `ref.scopes` the same way it does an ability (`auraRef`), and
  `index.test.js` lets `kind: 'enhancement'` carry `target` — for `aura` and nothing else;
- `resolveModifierEntries` SPLITS such a record: the ordinary effects stay ungated (an enhancement
  addresses its bearer), the aura effects come back as a second entry carrying `scopes`, so the
  bearer collects them only if the bearer matches the gate. 22.01 puts the model inside its own
  aura; it does not make a Captain part of the DEATH COMPANY, and Sanguinary Tear's +1 Strength
  must not land on the Captain wearing it;
- `datasheetEntriesFor` covers the other two cards — `leaderEnhNames` (the unit the bearer joined,
  certain by 22.01, no chip) and `auraOn` (anyone the player marked);
- `aurasReaching` finds the source by `enhKey(u.enh) === enhKey(rec.name)` over the roster list, so
  `rosterUnits` now carries `enh` (chosen or mandatory, as everywhere else in this feature).

**An enhancement can also address the bearer's UNIT** (2026-08-25), which is not the same as an aura
and far more common — 89 relics of the 961. "Models in the bearer's unit have the Deep Strike
ability", "while the bearer is leading a unit, ranged weapons equipped by models in that unit have
[IGNORES COVER]": 19.04 gives an enhancement exactly one direction beyond the single model it is worn
by, and this is it. Those effects carry `target: 'led'` — `resolveModifierEntries` still hands them
to the BEARER (its `own` split is "everything that is not an aura"), and `datasheetEntriesFor` now
hands the same effects to the unit he joined, keyed on `leaderEnhNames`. Until then they were `self`
and stopped at the bearer's card, so a Captain's Seals of Reconquest gave nobody but the Captain his
own 5+ invulnerable save. Two things decide the split when authoring one:
- a sentence that names the BEARER ("add 1 to the bearer's Wounds characteristic") stays `self`,
  even when the next sentence in the same relic is unit-wide — eleven relics mix the two;
- `while the bearer is leading a unit` keeps its `cond: ['unit-leading']`. The bearer's own card is
  gated by it as before; on the card it reached `from: 'led'` the condition is proven by arrival
  (`proven()` in rosterStatMods), because that record is only there because a Leader is attached.

**A DETACHMENT RULE can grant an aura too** (2026-08-23) — "Friendly IMPERIAL KNIGHTS models have
the following ability: Assisted Targeting (Aura): while a friendly ADEPTUS MECHANICUS unit is within
6"…". I had this filed as needing TWO keyword gates and therefore a second scope field. It does not:
the problem was never the record shape but what the reader was given. `ruleScopes` over the whole
body MERGES the carrier and the receiver into one gate (Cogbound Alliance →
`[IMPERIAL KNIGHTS, ADEPTUS MECHANICUS]`), which is what would have handed the buff to the carrier.
Read the REACH CLAUSE alone and the same function returns exactly the receiving gate. So:

- the generator's `detachmentAuraScopes` matches `While a/an … within N" of …` inside a body that
  carries an `(Aura)` label, and stores `ruleScopes` of that clause as `ref.scopes`. It is
  **fail-closed**, unlike every other reader here: a detachment rule addresses the whole army, so an
  unreadable gate would splash over the entire list rather than over one card. Two different reach
  clauses (Custodes' Revered Companions buffs each way) cannot be said by one record either, and
  return nothing. `index.test.js` refuses `target: 'aura'` on a detachment rule without a gate;
- the CARRIER is not modelled at all. Nothing in the list vouches for it and the player is judging
  the 6" anyway, so `aurasReaching` offers one chip headed by the DETACHMENT
  ("Brandfast Oathband · Mobile Sensor Relays", its name and text taken from the detachment's own
  localised rule rather than from `ruleInfo`'s datasheet lookup) to every unit the reach clause
  names — and only while that detachment is fielded (`detIds`, fail-closed for the same reason);
- `resolveModifierEntries` therefore keeps the aura effects OUT of the automatic path (the rest of
  the rule stays gated by its body's own scopes, as before), and `datasheetEntriesFor` delivers them
  when the chip is marked;
- `effectApplies` grew a `strict` flag for exactly this case: the "the extraction matched no
  datasheet, so distrust it" escape is right for a rule printed on one card and wrong for one
  addressing the army. Questor Forgepact's aura names ADEPTUS MECHANICUS — allies this list cannot
  field — and failing open there would buff every Knight. Reaching nobody is the honest answer, and
  Cogbound Alliance stays an empty record because of it.

Two records carry it: `Mobile Sensor Relays` (SUSTAINED HITS 1 for LEAGUES OF VOTANN INFANTRY near a
TRANSPORT) and `Ensorcelled Animus` (+1 WS in melee for SEKHETAR ROBOTS near a PSYKER — previously a
`never` sentinel). Both gates are pinned by name in `index.test.js` rather than trusted to the next
generator run: a gate is only as good as the reading behind it, and nothing else in the record shows
what it reads.

Writing them turned up a hole in that reader, fixed the same day: **`ruleScopes` knew the slash
alternation and not the English list** — "a WRAITHBLADES, WRAITHGUARD or WRAITHLORD unit" kept
WRAITHLORD alone and "friendly JAKHALS or GOREMONGERS units" matched nothing at all. `KW_ALT` now
spans `,`/`or`/`and` runs. Measured over all 30 factions, that moved 16 rules to MORE units (each
one a rule that had been hiding from units it names — Ork Bully Boyz never reached Nobz, Wrath of
the Rock reached 57 fewer units than it names) and two the other way, both correctly: Skitarii
Hunter Cohort and Cult of Blood name their targets in a list, so they had matched no keyword end to
end and been shown to the whole army by escape 2. Two aura records gained a gate they should always
have had — Abaddon's Mark of Chaos Ascendant (HERETIC ASTARTES INFANTRY/MOUNTED excluding DAMNED)
and GSC's Martial Espionage — so their chips no longer offer themselves to units the prose never
names. The numbers are in `ruleTargets.js`'s own header; re-measure the same way after touching
those patterns, and diff the per-rule visible unit SETS, not just the totals.

Still empty on purpose: Cogbound Alliance (above), Aeldari's `Shepherds of the Dead` (grants a
faction ability, which this layer has no `stat` for) and World Eaters' `Idols of Khorne`, which now
reads its gate but needs one of three once-per-battle idols to be the one selected this round — a
pick this layer does not model for a detachment rule.

Of the conditional effects that stay sentinels, the reasons are worth knowing before trying to
shrink the number: 26 name part of a unit the rule's own prose gives no statement for
(`blocked-subset`), a handful restrict to a weapon chosen at deployment that nothing records
(`blocked-weapon`), and the rest are `never` — resolved per attack, by range, by an aura, or by a
once-per-battle activation the player simply decides. Adding a phase clock (2026-08-22) freed
eleven of them and no more; the remainder are not waiting on machinery.

What is still genuinely missing, feature-wise: import reads the GW app, listhammer.info (both
modes) and the WTC family, but no `.ros` (BattleScribe is dead — BSData targets New Recruit now),
and **export** writes a GW-app-shaped text that is close to but not byte-exact with the real thing.
