<!-- The roster's own list, as both BUILDING screens draw it: the editor's Units tab and the
     creation wizard's units step. Sections, attached-unit blocks, per-entry actions and the
     open/closed state of one entry's configuration.

     One component rather than the two near-identical copies the two views held (`.redu-*` and
     `.rcunit-*`), for the same reason `RosterUnitRow` is one: the copies drift, and the attached
     block in particular is three coordinated pieces (the indent, the role tag, the block total)
     that have to agree.

     The configuration itself stays with the CALLER, through the `fields` scoped slot —
     `UnitEditorFields` needs the roster's detachments, its other entries, the enhancement options
     and the leader targets, all of which the views already compute. This component decides only
     WHERE those fields appear:

       - a wide screen puts them inline, under the row, as an accordion;
       - a narrow one puts them in a modal, because the list shares its width with the catalogue
         beside it and a wargear editor does not fit in half a phone;
       - `placement="pane"` puts them NOWHERE — the desk layout (≥1200px) has a column of its own
         for them, so this component only reports which entry is chosen and marks that row.

     The modal is teleported to <body> and therefore leaves the view's faction-accent scope behind,
     which is what FactionAccentScope is for (see RosterUnitRulesModal.vue for the same trap). -->
