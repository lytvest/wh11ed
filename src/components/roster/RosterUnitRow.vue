<!-- The collapsed line of one roster entry, as the two BUILDING screens draw it: the editor's
     Units tab and the creation wizard's config step. One component rather than a third copy of the
     same spans — the two used to hold identical markup under different class prefixes, which is
     how they drifted apart before (see .roster-sum in style.css for the same lesson).

     Renders the CONTENT of the row, not the tile around it: both callers put this inside their own
     <button>, which is also why nothing here is focusable.

     What it shows, in order of how quickly it needs to be read:
       - the name, and the warlord star;
       - chips for the facts that distinguish THIS entry from another copy of the same datasheet —
         how many models, which attachment slot it fills, its enhancement, its allegiance;
       - the wargear the player actually CHOSE.

     What it deliberately does not show is the default loadout. It is identical on every copy of a
     datasheet, it is printed on the datasheet itself, and it was three or four lines of dim
     0.74rem text per unit standing between the reader and the two facts above. It is still one tap
     away, inside the accordion's own "Default wargear" block. -->
