           header band/weapon-table headers/ability tags all key off --accent). It's placed HERE,
           inside modal-body rather than wrapped around the whole component by callers like
           UnitEditorFields.vue's own <Teleport>, because a second Teleport (this component's own

           actual modal DOM to <body> a second time, past the outer wrapper's div — CSS custom

/* Rendered into DatasheetCard's #before-keywords slot, so it sits INSIDE the card just above the
   closing Keywords line. It has to read as belonging to the card AND as visibly not part of the
   printed datasheet, so it borrows the card's own vocabulary for "a block of a different kind" —
   the one `.ds-damaged` already uses: the same rounded box and rhythm as `.ds-ability-group`,
   plus a solid accent bar down the left edge.
   Two things separate it from the printed groups: the border is DASHED (the ordinary annotation
   convention — this was added by your roster, it is not ink on the card) and the heading keeps
   accent-coloured text on a transparent strip instead of the groups' solid accent bar with white
   text, which would claim it IS printed. The wash is lighter than theirs (4% vs 8%) for the same
   reason. Everything keys off `--accent`, so it stays right in all 30 faction colours and in both
   themes; no fixed hue is introduced (`.ds-damaged` can afford its red because "damaged" means
   one thing — this block does not).
   Deliberately NOT an accordion itself: what applies is always visible, and only the individual
   rule bodies collapse. A container accordion would add a second level of chevrons and would dump
   every rule body at once when opened. */

     against `.ds-ability-group`'s own bled, over-wide box). Cancel just the escape; `.ds-card`'s
