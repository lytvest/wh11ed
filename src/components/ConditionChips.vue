// Purely presentational: `switches` come from rosterGameContext's switchesFor() (or stratagemsFor),
// and flipping one is the parent's business (only it knows which player is being drawn). A chip is
// inert when the tracker owns the answer (`auto`) or when the rules forbid the change (`blocked` —
// a Battle-shocked unit cannot be targeted with stratagems).
