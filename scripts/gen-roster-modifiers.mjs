// Generate and audit src/data/rosterModifiers/<slug>.js — the numeric modifier layer for the
// roster builder's unit card (Tier C — src/components/roster/CLAUDE.md). A record says what a rule
// DOES to a statline or a weapon profile ("+2 to the Strength characteristic"), which the
// attributed prose blocks of Tier B can only describe.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS BUILT THE WAY IT IS
//
// The effects cannot be derived. wh40k-appdata carries essentially no structural modifiers — 961
// enhancements yield 6 ability links and 2 weapon-profile links, everything else is prose — and
// GW's own app doesn't recompute statlines either, because 40k modifiers are overwhelmingly
// CONDITIONAL. So the effects are read by a human. This script's job is not to guess them: it is
// to keep that hand-read layer HONESTLY TIED to the prose it was read from, so that when GW
// rewrites a rule we know exactly which records are now suspect.
//
// Each record therefore pins its source three ways:
//   sid   the appdata UUID — the identity. Survives a rename, unlike a name.
//   hash  sha1 of the NORMALISED English prose, first 8 chars. The affiliation: change the
//         wording and this stops matching, which is the entire early-warning system.
//   ver   the appdata data_version the record was last reviewed against, for the report.
//
// What a record does NOT carry is a scope. Which units a rule bears on is already computed at
// render time by src/composables/ruleTargets.js (Tier B's keyword layer) from that same prose —
// storing it again here would be a second copy free to drift from the first. An effect may name
// a `scope` INDEX into ruleScopes(), which is how an effect binds to one statement of a
// multi-part rule (Necrons' Cold Fervour gives +2 S to DESTROYER CULT in its first bullet and to
// every other NECRONS model in its second).
//
// DETACHABILITY. Everything this layer owns lives under src/data/rosterModifiers/. Delete that
// directory and the app degrades cleanly to Tiers A+B — attributed prose, no recomputed numbers.
// Nothing is written into the hand-authored faction files.
//
// STATUSES the audit reports, and what each means for you:
//   stale   the prose changed under a reviewed record → RE-READ the rule, fix `effects`, re-stamp
//   new     prose that looks like it touches a statline but has no record → review and fill in
//   orphan  a record whose source no longer exists in appdata → delete it or re-point its sid
//   ok      hash matches → nothing to do
// A record is kept even when the review concluded "no numeric effect" (`effects: []`,
// `reviewed: true`) — otherwise every future run would propose that same rule again forever.
// Records exist only for candidates and for anything reviewed; a rule that has never looked like
// a candidate is re-evaluated from its current text on every run, so a rewrite that turns it into
// one surfaces as `new`.
