// Guards the squared-corner design: `border-radius` is not a thing we sprinkle.
//
// Before 2026-08-25 the app carried 314 radius declarations across 100 files, at 4px, 5px or
// 6px depending on which day the file was written — the same kind of element rounded three
// different ways. That is what an unenforced default decays into, so this check keeps the
// squaring from decaying the same way. Run by `npm run radii`.
//
// Adding a radius is allowed — it just has to be a decision. Put it in ALLOWED with the reason.
//
// EVERY spelling counts, not just the `border-radius` shorthand. Until 2026-08-27 this only
// matched that one, so four `border-top-left-radius: 4px` sat on the weapon-table headers in plain
// sight with the check reporting a clean sweep — the corners a reader could see were the ones it
// could not. The longhands and the logical properties (`border-start-end-radius`…) are the same
// declaration written another way and are matched the same.
